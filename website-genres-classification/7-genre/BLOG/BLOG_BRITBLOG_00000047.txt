Easy
It was quiz night once again tonight and we went down to The Cutting Room to enter and also to enjoy our gallon of free beer from Wednesday's victory. We only went and won again - that's three quizzes on the trot now! The scoring was a bit complicated, but we got 50 out of 55 right. We knew two of the other answers as well, but giving an incorrect answer in that round meant nullifying our correct answers, so we didn't enter them, as we weren't 100% sure. Our nearest rival got 43, so we won by a loooooooooong way.
The proposed night for drinking our 30 prize is Thursday, as it's St Patrick's Day and we can get some free silly hats if we drink lots of Guinness.
The team name tonight was "Underwood's Independent Traders" a reference to Matt's quest to find a van for work, Ian mentioning an advert in the local paper for Reliant Robins, and our love of Only Fools and Horses.

Functional
Everything that you can see is once again fully functional. I still have to sort lots of my admin stuff, editing posts, adding pool results, adding photos, for instance, but all of the public stuff works.

You know it's Red Nose Day when...
... you walk past Darth Vader at Leicester train station, on your way to work.

Failure
I was just leaving work tonight to walk into Leicester to pick up my car from its service and MOT, when the garage called and told me it had failed. They didn't have time to put the things right today, so they've kept it until tomorrow. That meant I had to walk to the train station instead. I got some chips in Melton and got home around an hour later than normal.
I was going to sort all of my site out tonight, but I'm knackered, so I'm just doing the comments part. You should be able to use it from now!
*Additional: The photos page works again now as well.

More spoils of victory
Jon, Ian, Matt & Lisa, and myself went down to The Cutting Room tonight to drink our Sunday quiz victory drinks worth 30. The Wednesday quiz following the football was much better than the one a couple of weeks ago (i.e. it had proper questions). It still cost 1 to enter, we got free sausage and chips, and WE WON! Yes, on Sunday night we'll claim our prize of a free gallon of beer or three bottles of wine, depending on our mood.
I'm starting to get used to this winning feeling, with my pool team and our quiz crew doing so well. Let's hope my car's MOT carries on this run tomorrow...
*Additional: Tonight's team name was "We're off to Button Moon (with Mr. Spoon)". Irisha should type that into Google for an explanation.
