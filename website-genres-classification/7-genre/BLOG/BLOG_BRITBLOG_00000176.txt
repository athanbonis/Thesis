RoboCOP gives me the willies  
I know you probably donâ€™t want to hear this. You want to read happy blogs that make you smile. Theyâ€™re fun and exciting; they make you want to read more and have a giggle while youâ€™re doing it. Escapism I think they call it. Come to think of it, I want you to read happy blogs, which make you smile, too. But today was a god-dammed nightmare.If you want cheering up, DONâ€™T READ THIS!I also apologise, once again in such a short while, (but for a different reason). I didnâ€™t update this blog yesterday, because of what I am going to tell you. Although Iâ€™ve posted this on the right day, if anybody is reading this regularly, youâ€™ll know I skipped Saturdayâ€™s posting. The truth is, I was not left alone long enough to post this Saturday. However, after a day like Iâ€™ve just had, I knew Iâ€™d need Sunday to let you know what happened on Sunday too. I may be a day behind but I'll catch up.(Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s confusing for me). Yesterday afternoon (Saturday) was the beginning of turbulent times. When Mr Blue came round for what I thought was to cheer me up, it didnâ€™t take me long to realise this was not going to happen.Mr Blueâ€™s whole demeanour was completely shocking. He turned up on my doorstep laden with DVDâ€™s and upon first inspection it looked like it was going to be a great afternoon/evening and long cosy night spent together. His choice of films shocked me. They were all gruesome, bloodthirsty horrors, which under normal circumstances I would probably enjoy. What bothered me though, was that they were hardly the type I expected from a pursuing loved one. It would appear he thought he didnâ€™t have to try too hard. And he didnâ€™t. We sat and watched the zombies kill and mutilate the living, until they too became how I felt. A living nightmare. All this happened in total utter silence and separate chairs! Something was definitely playing on his mind. By the time the â€˜Night of the Living Deadâ€™ finished I knew something was wrong. So I asked him what was bothering him. All he could say was - â€œWhere did you go last night!â€ in a demanding and fierce voice I had never heard from his lips before. I didnâ€™t know he could be so cruel.I tried to lie, as I had trained myself so expertly to do (or so I thought), but his next words told me he knew all about my evening out with Mr Blonde and he wasnâ€™t impressed, nor was he going to let me off lightly. â€˜I donâ€™t like what you have done one bit. Doesnâ€™t what Iâ€™ve done for you, mean anything to you?â€™ We argued and I tried to tell him how it really was. How I wasnâ€™t really interested in the Aussie nut- Mr Blonde. I even played the helpless maiden and swore my heart belonged to him (Mr Blue) and no-one else would ever come close to match up. It was like dealing with a psychotic, neurotic stranger. He must have seen straight through me. He wasnâ€™t having any of it and became angrier. It took a lot of persuading to make him even listen to me. From that moment on the conversation was very upsetting. He said I should have remembered that the phone was bugged for my protection, and I shouldnâ€™t be abusing the safety measures that had been put into place, (after a lot of planning and overtime on his part), by going out with every Tom, Dick and Harry which took my fancy. Threatening to undo everything HE had worked for. This I hasten to add, riled me no end. He was making me sound like a slapper and although I had regretted the whole â€˜Mr Blondeâ€™ situation, Iâ€™m not the sort of person to take such verbal abuse without putting up a fight for what I feel is right. Iâ€™m not that sort of â€˜easyâ€™ gal and Iâ€™ve had to contend with a lot of bother in my life. Weâ€™re not married, so I didnâ€™t feel the way he spoke to me was justified. He didnâ€™t need to act so possessive. Had I really done something so wrong? For the rest of the evening I had to be careful what I said. I can see now, how the clichÃ© â€˜stepping on eggshellsâ€™ rings so true. It was like he had come round to bully me, not protect me. He did stay in the end, but not with my full consent. I just didnâ€™t dare tell him to go. The fear I was feeling, (and still feel now) forced me to come to terms with what was happening and think logically about my actions. If I'd asked him to leave, not only would I have made myself sound even more ungrateful for all the hard work he had put into my case, I would have also made him any angrier.It was a terrifying experience, which bought back bad memories for me. He should have realised this. He was supposed to someone I could trust and rely on. Far from it. I felt like a prisoner in my own home. A hostage of the one person I thought I could feel safe with. I justly saw Mr Blue for what he really was. His true colours shone through and I tell you now, I didnâ€™t like what I saw.When the post woman knocked on the front door I jumped out of my skin and at the same time I ran to greet her. For safety? ( I had previously asked her knock, a certain, familiar way. As I didnâ€™t expect much post and was wary of anyone coming to the door). To get around this, I had given her the excuse that I had a top secret job and although I couldnâ€™t explain what it was - any mail for me was of the utmost importance, she was very obliging. Kind, and keen to help. Apparently, I â€˜really made her dayâ€™ as she said full of excitement the last time she visited with what was plain to see only a water bill!) I thought about telling her what was happening and to ring the police, but in my head that sounded stupid. Where would I start? A policeman was already in my house, sitting on my armchair. Talking to someone else, was like a breath of fresh air. I felt stifled by Mr Blue, constantly watching my every move. This feeling of escapism, however, did not last long. Before I knew it, he was by my side looking over my shoulder as I opened the one letter the post woman had delivered. I suspected he was also listening to what I was saying to the post woman. What was in the letter made my blood run cold. It was from Mr Green. I had been sacked because my references and CV were not what they seemed. Although it was even signed by Mr Green, whether it was really from him, I had my doubts. I have never seen his signature before. It could have been from anyone. I couldnâ€™t imagine Mr Green not talking this over with me first. Being such a gentle and conscientious world loving type. Mr Blue, still didnâ€™t say much as he read the contents of the letter over my shoulder. In fact, I swear, when I looked up once, Iâ€™m sure I sure a flicker of a smile cross his face. I thought I could trust him, but by this time, instinct told me to be very careful. Oh, of course he offered the expected â€˜Iâ€™m so sorry for youâ€™ line, but my guts told me he wasnâ€™t in a dependable protective mood. Hell, he made me feel like a hostage in my own home. I wanted to ask him to leave, but he mood he was in, I didnâ€™t dare. He is a specially trained policeman for gods sake. What was I supposed to do?I hate to admit, I just put up with him. All night long. Within the few days I had known him, he had completely changed his personality. It made me realise I didnâ€™t actually know him at all. He wasnâ€™t or isnâ€™t the man I thought he was. And after yesterday, I know I donâ€™t even like him anymore. But by then, I didnâ€™t dare say anything to annoy him further.Iâ€™m also sorry to say, I played the victim. Bit my tongue and got through those (long) hours as best as I could. I let him get away with everything I would normally speak up about. Basically, it was plain to see, he was very suspicious of me for seeing another man. He didnâ€™t let me out of his sight. Wasnâ€™t going to believe anything I said. Whereas I expect comfort and calm, consoling words, all I got was a frightening monster, I hardly recognised. Once, when I went to the toilet, I did consider using my mobile phone to call Janine the police receptionist to ask her if he was supposed to be here. But there were two things wrong with this. 1. I assumed, he wasnâ€™t supposed to making a habit of staying the night in such a way I had let him before and that probably wouldn't go in my favour.2. He had knocked on the toilet door, impatiently asking me to hurry up.There would seem to be no escape from him. Letting me out of his sight was not on his agenda. I didnâ€™t even have the space to cry and I so wanted to.Why is everything going so wrong?Is this my punishment for being so unkind about Mr Blonde? If only I hadnâ€™t been so selfish â€“ so childish â€“ so picky. Mr Blonde may have called round tonight and saved me from this hellhole. Who was it that once said, â€˜what goes round comes round?â€™

How to chuck a sickie and an Aussie, all in one day!  
II didn't go to work today. I just could not face it. So I rang in sick. I honestly donâ€™t feel well either. Ms White sounded quite disappointed as if I spoilt her plans. I wonder what she had in store for me today?Iâ€™ve been thinking long and hard about how to deal with this situation. It has been suggested that I go to Mr Green and explain how Ms White has got it in for me. This is probably the sensible thing to do, but how is it going to help my fake CV? Monday morning, I will catch the Head Teacher, Mr Green before he starts teaching and see what I can do. I had a phone call today from Mr Blonde! I was stunned. When I asked him how he got my number he said he managed to prise it out of the school secretary. I never gave her permission to do that. She could get me into a lot of trouble passing on confidential information like that. Anyway, he had such a good time he wants to do it all over again. (How thick-skinned is this man?)Unfortunately, I was rather rude to him and told him I didnâ€™t like people who were not themselves. (Ha! Thatâ€™s a laugh, coming from me!) He seemed to find it funny and kept pressurizing me to go back out with him. In the end I agreed - to get him off the phone. I was feeling so ill, I couldnâ€™t think what else to do. If I do nothing, and donâ€™t turn up, he still does not know where I live, so I think Iâ€™m safe! I only wished I felt more in control of my brain. I would have loved to have asked him a few more revealing questions about his Australian life. Ask him why he feels the need to talk like such an dawk! Still, I suppose that's what I get for messing about with him in the first place. I only intended to use him as a tool for getting back at Ms White. Now it's backfired!I also rang up Mr Blue and told him what Ms White had said yesterday. He seemed concerned and quite annoyed. Despite this, he also explained that I was not to worry. He hadn't told me before, but people under the witness protection scheme often come up against this sort of prejudice - having their fake references found out for what they really are. Fake. His exact words were - "It comes with the territory, I'm afraid. If they do sack you may have to stop worrying about looking for another job and let the Home Office look after you. You'll only come up against the same problems where ever you run to."I didn't like the way he seemed to be so blasÃ© about my life. And using the words 'run to' as if he knew my thoughts about running away to a circus. Before all this happened, the prospect of never having another job always appealed. I couldn't wait to retire and receive that golden handshake. Now I feel like I am being forced into a corner and giving up my independence, Iâ€™m more determined to do my own thing, even if that means working for a living. (Which is a bit of an eye-opener for me!) I didnâ€™t tell Mr Blue about Mr Blonde. I think that is better left as another one of my secrets. Mr Blue is popping round later, with some DVD's we can watch together. To cheer me up. However, on the phone, he sounded like he should be the one who needs cheering up. Talk about grumpy. Iâ€™m sure I havenâ€™t done anything to upset him, but it sure feels that way. I guess, heâ€™s just worried about me â€“ thatâ€™s all. At least I can talk to you about all this. I'm signing off for today, as I can hardly think, let alone type. I need my beauty sleep, I'm not looking too smart right now. It will give me a chance to think about what I am going to do with the rest of my life. Take it from me, it will take more than a few hours kip to make myself presentable for visitors. One thingâ€™s for sure -I can not let Mr Blue see me like this. He'll run a mile!May post a little extra here later, if Iâ€™m feeling better or there is something new/exciting to report. (If only!) Hope Mr Blue is a little more happier by the time he gets here! I need his support and thatâ€™s exactly what I intend to get. (I can be a tenacious cow when I want to be too). Itâ€™s what Mr Blue gets paid for, isnâ€™t it? Handling me!

Named and shamed. In more ways than one.  
Well, I had a hideous day at work today. I've got a cold coming on, which is making me feel light headed, dizzy (what's new eh?) and everything tastes flippin' awful. To cap it all, I've managed to annoy probably the only reader of this blog who lives in Australia. My apologies again to whoever you are. As I said in yesterday's comments, one sometimes forgets that people are actually reading this. I simply assume that surfers accidently stumble across this site whilst looking for something else. The comments are the only evidence. They make it real. They support me, when the going gets tough. Today, was one of those days. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At work, I had to haul up a member of staff for not keeping to the lousy washing up rota I have been put in charge of. Thanks a lot Ms White for improving my popularity and making my new life so miserable. She also said a strange, and very worrying thing to me today. When I popped into the office at dinnertime to write my blog she was still there. Normally she always goes out for lunch â€“ in her opinion, school dinners are full of e numbers and play havoc with her sensitive stomach. In my opinion she goes out because no one likes her. Not even the children. Either that or she has some fancy man who is blind, with no legs and cannot run away. Anyway, as I was saying, she was guarding her computer like a hawk. Then we actually had a conversation. As far as I can remember, and Iâ€™m still in shock, it went like thisâ€¦â€œAre you going to lunch today?â€ I asked trying not to sound suspicious. â€œNo.â€ she replied with a face like thunder. â€œNot that itâ€™s any of your business.â€â€œOkay, keep your hair on. I donâ€™t want a conversation.â€ I said turning round to leave. â€œNot so fast. I havenâ€™t finished with you yet. Did you sort out the washing up rota this morning? Find the culprit?â€â€œI tried but itâ€™s a very touchy subject. I havenâ€™t been here long; I donâ€™t want to make enemies over a few dirty mugs and plates.â€ I laughed. â€œItâ€™s really not that important to me. Having friends is. Not that youâ€™ll know much about that.â€ â€œI know more than you think, Sam." (I hate it when she uses my name, she makes it sound so unpleasant).â€œWhat is that supposed to mean? I said immediately on the defensive. She couldnâ€™t have found out about my blog, I have always been so careful, deleting sent emails and erasing the history pages. â€œWhat I mean, â€œ she said with a huge smile on her face, â€œis that I have been checking your references. Not only are they fake, but no-one has heard of you at the schools and colleges you put down in your C.V.â€It was the last thing I expected. My mind went blank and I couldnâ€™t think of anything to say. So in my state of shock, she carried on.â€œI shall be passing the washing up rota onto another, more capable, member of staff. From what Iâ€™ve discovered, when Mr Green, hereâ€™s about your lies, you wonâ€™t be working here any longer. Your not safe to be working around children.â€As I walked out of the office feeling well and truly caught out, I heard her cackle with amusement. I have since decided not to worry too much. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I know this sounds as if I donâ€™t care, but I canâ€™t let the likes of her stress me out too much. Iâ€™ve got to stay alert and therefore, cannot afford to let the words of the office cow upset me. After all, she doesnâ€™t know all my background details; itâ€™s only the C.V sheâ€™s talking about. So what if I lose my job, at least it wonâ€™t kill me.For the rest of the day I put on a brave face and carried on, as I always do. I worked with 'Tank Boy' for most of the day. He was still being good (for me) which wasn't a problem in itself. But when I caught him demanding money in exchange for protection, I just had to say something, undoing all the hard work I put into helping him see sense the other day. He was not pleased with me at all, but what could I do? Most of the other kids his age are small weaklings in comparison to his hefty stature. There was no way I could jeopardise my job any further, just for a kid, even if I am going to get the sack soon. If I do go, I shall miss â€˜Tankâ€™. I have always had a soft spot for â€˜him. And Mr Green of course, with his holy holey jumpers.The last thing 'Tank' said to me before he rushed through the school gates at the end of the day, mowing down anyone in his way, was "No-one likes me. I might as well run away and join a circus!"Perhaps thatâ€™s not a bad idea. For me, I mean. I could re-start my life, under my terms. Who would find me, hiding within a travelling circus?

Asylum Seeker from OZ.  
Listen up! I have devised a system, similar to the asylum system the Home Secretary has put into place, or trying to. (Iâ€™m a bit confused to whether this has been put into place yet, but then again, arenâ€™t we all?). Itâ€™s only similar, in the respect that my system also looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to enter my life. Well, if the Home Secretary can ensure our immigrants are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, and not a horde of Slavic hop-pickers and Chinese cocklers, then so can I. Apologies if you are a Slavic hop-picker â€“ I was only using you as an example. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re a very nice human being, but you wouldnâ€™t have what it takes to pass my rigorous points system. And tough, Iâ€™m afraid I have to be, for both my security and sanity. Thatâ€™s why my subjectâ€™s qualifying total is based on the following rules:1. Subject starts with 50 point.2. The subject does something I like â€“ thatâ€™s good. No points deducted. I may even add a point or two, if they are being particularly impressive!3. The subject does something I donâ€™t like â€“thatâ€™s bad and a point gets deducted! Maybe more if Iâ€™m feeling ruthless or just plain pedantic. But hey! Thatâ€™s up to me. I make these rules up. Hereâ€™s how my date last-night, panned out.I walked to the White Horse ten minutes early. I had never been there before, and wanted to make sure we got a table, not far from the toilets. (Or the shit house, as I have heard him call them at work, too many times). Half of me was excited and couldn't wait to meet Mr. Blonde again, he looked like the type of guy to have fun with, even if he was a male version of a bimbo. (A dimbo, a dumbo? Either way, you know what I mean!) The other half of me was disappointed that he hadn't obviously been as keen as me, otherwise he would have been early too. Deduct one point for not planning ahead. (49)Itâ€™s not a case of great mindâ€™s think alike, so we could never be soul mates, oops, there goes another one! (48)The pub was noisy, (47) Full of pipe smokers and loud pipe music. (45) Could have put a bit more thought into where we went. (44)When I walked in heads turned to look at my pink suit. (That would have been a point for me, if it worked that way). Unfortunately, when I looked round at what at first, I thought were admiring glances, I was quick to notice how - not even the women - had bothered to change out of their lumberjack/fishing gear/welly boots etc. You name it, they wore it, all that is, expect for something smart and business like â€“ a pink suit maybe? I felt over-dressed and under-informed. Deducted 3 points here purely for the humiliation of not being told â€˜not to dress upâ€™. (41)While I waited I sat on a stool by the bar watching a group of darts players in chunky knitted cream jumpers, chucking their arrows and playing drunken games, giggling like kids. By the time the hands on the clock above the empty fireplace, had spun round to half past nine, not only was I fuming (40) Jeffery Jaffer (donâ€™t even ask) was now standing on the table with his shirt off, balancing 4 pints of real ale on his hideous stomach ledge with a precarious additional pint on his head! There of course appeared no end to his talent, and for this shower of entertainment, I deducted another point. (39) And another one point for the illusive Mr. Blondeâ€™s lateness. The poor man was now down to 38 points and he hadnâ€™t even turned up yet.Then, as if heâ€™d read my mind, he suddenly burst through the doors looking like he had just stepped out of work. I had no idea which school would stay open until gone nine-thirty, just to have an Interactive White Board fitted. I know some of the teachers have a lot of work on their plate, paperwork and markings to get through, but staying that late? I guess I'm just a suspicious kind of gal. I deducted one more point because my instinct told me he wasnâ€™t quite telling the truth about where he had been. (37)Then I felt guilty. I wasnâ€™t telling the whole truth either, so I gave him one point back and felt much better. (38) After he arrived, things didnâ€™t get any better;He had a five o'clock shadow. (Deduct one more = 37)The same work suit, creased and slightly whiffy (35 â€“ I point for each bad point)The only thing which was looking well groomed were his golden locks. I almost gave him a point for this, as it was his best feature BUT it was so blatantly obvious this was the most important aspect in his life, I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it. Every five minutes, he eyed himself up in the mirror and fiddled with his feminine hair. No, tell a lie, he did stop his self grooming once, as this big boobed woman tottered past us in stilettos and a very tiny skirt. (DEDUCTED TWO WHOLE POINTS FOR THAT! â€“ ONE FOR EACH BOOB!) He was now down to 33, although he didnâ€™t know it. I was silently SMUG.He suggested he was hungry (in need of some tucker) and we should go out for a meal and â€˜hit the turpsâ€™. (Spontaneity, I LOVE that! Add one point =34) Even though I had already eaten, I let him off! Then I realised he had come up with this idea, not long after he said my pink suit was making me stand out like a â€˜shag on a rockâ€™. I still donâ€™t know what this means, and at first I took this as a compliment, but I suspect he noticed my attire was a little out of place amongst a room full of pipe smoking duffers. (33)Sadly, things didnâ€™t improve. We stood outside, in the rain (32) because he called for a cab from the pub phone and insisted it would turn up any minute, which I hasten to add it didnâ€™t. (not planning ahead -deduct another point â€“ now heâ€™s really slumming it at 31 points and the date was yet to get going!)Waited another half hour for the cab to turn up (30)Obviously he hadn't booked the restaurant in advance, (29) He said Chinese, but there were no cocklers there, it was actually Cantonese. (28)So we had to wait another half hour until we even got served (27) and proceeded to encourage me to â€˜bog inâ€™. (Tuck in? Eat up?) (26)He then said the waiter was â€˜as useful as tits on a bull!â€™ They never said that on Neighbours or Home and Away). (25)Meanwhile we yabbered on fairly easily, despite the fact that I had began to think I should have bought an Australian dictionary along with me and it was difficult to talk to someone who didnâ€™t remove their face from the mirrors which spanned round the whole room shouting Feng Shui. A decoration only he was pleased with. (24) What bugged me most must have been the way he constantly flicked his head from side to side, as to impress me with his â€˜movingâ€™ hair, like he was on some sort of advert for shampoo. I half expected him to get out a bottle of Head and Shoulders in between our starter and main course! Therefore, head flicking is BAD (23)And positively unhygienic. (22) By this time I realised he was a heavy drinker and the â€˜Amber Fluidâ€™ did not agree with him. In such a short space of time he had already drunk his way through 6 pints. (deduct three points, one for each I thought was in excess - (21).Once the booze was well in control, he started the moaning. (20) Nothing in England was as good as it was in Australia. Even our waves were â€˜bodgyâ€™ (19) (whatever that meant). I assumed they were not substantial for surfing. What he meant when he said â€˜there were never any white pointers on the beachâ€™ is anybodyâ€™s guess. I deducted another in case that was rude. At this stage he only had 18 points to spare. I should have been hoping for big things to happen, if there was going to be any signs of improvement. As it happened, when the meal was over, he suggested we walked back along the beach. It would be romantic he said. Ran out of money, more like. (Deduct another â€“ now at 17 points I felt I was really scraping the barrel. But Mr Blonde had already beaten me to it, by drinking it all. After a long walk back along the beach, where it could have been a romantic moonlit stroll, I had to practically run to keep up with his enormous strides, and Iâ€™m not talking about his trousers, although when I looked, they were rather baggy. Another reason he had a point deducted, giving him a lousy score of 16, so far was because his second favourite subject , apart from his hair, was football, or soccer as he called it. If I could have blown a whistle and sent him off I would have, without hesitation.When we got to my street, I panicked. I didnâ€™t want him to know where I lived, in case he came round again when Mr Blue was there, so what did I do?Iâ€™m embarrassed to say I walked as bold as brass, right up to a block of flats and stood blocking the doorway with my body, feebly explaining that my landlord didnâ€™t like me bringing home boyfriends. He tried to kiss me goodnight, which strangely I politely obliged, (I think I was waiting for him to develop some clever strategy to increase his points total) but after his high alcohol intake, he was too drunk to notice all I got was a mouthful of hair (15)When he asked to come up and said something about coming to look at my â€˜Mappa Tassie, I knew it was time to flee. Iâ€™m not stupid, Iâ€™ve heard of this one. (Admitedly, this wasnâ€™t from watching Neighbours). Mappa Tassie, is a map of Tasmania. He was referring to my pubic hair! (14)He said heâ€™d call me. I failed to remind him, I hadnâ€™t given him my home phone number, so if my estimation is right, I shouldnâ€™t see him again, until this time next year, when our whiteboard is due for an annual check up. His last incredible words to me, before he left, were that he thought I was spunky and heâ€™d had a â€˜pretty spiffyâ€™ time. (13)When he turned and walked away I dived into the nearest bush and watched him swagger off back home, surprisingly happy. The bush was a rose bush. I was scratched to pieces. (12) And covered in mud. (It had been raining earlier) (11)When I finally got home I breathed that inevitable sigh of relief. So, Mr Blonde scored a terrible 11 out of 50. If I could put him in an asylum, I would do, in fact , I donâ€™t think I would have let him into the country in the first place. Then again, that was not my area. I blame the Home Secretary for that mistake. I should have told him to rack off!

Day 7 at the School of Hard Knocks  
The last thing I thought of before I fell to sleep last night, was the first thing I thought of when I awoke (albeit bleary-eyed and full of Tequila). What on earth am I doing with two men in my life. For a short while I contemplated whether I should explain tonights plans to Mr Blue, for security reasons. Seconds later an inner voice told me that wasn't a wise idea.(Instinct again?) I'm not sure how Mr Blue feels about me, and I honestly didn't expect Sunday night to happen the way it did.I have been feeling quite lonely lately, which under the circumstances should be expected.Luckily Mr Blue has warned me that he is working overtime tonight, so there is not any awkward explaining to do. I wouldn't call this lying, I just haven't said anything. In my eyes that makes a big difference. Anyway, it's not as if tonight is going to be a serious date. I'm only really doing it to wind up Ms White, and as it seems to be working I might as well have fun while I'm doing it!Well, despite my keeness for the day to pass as quickly and painlessly as possible, it's been an interesting and productive day at school. Whilst counting down the hours here's what I got up to today. 1. Dinner time, I rang Mr Blonde from the school office phone, checking he was still on for tonight.2. The Man from Delmonte, he say YES!3. Better still it was great rubbing Ms White's nose in it, as she stood by listening in to my well rehearsed telephone conversation. I made sure I spoke loud and clear!4. This time it was my turn to smile all day.5. Nothing Ms White did today was able to change my brilliant mood. You should see the list of duties she gave me when I walked in this morning. Half of them include stuff that isin't relevant to my job description, such as being the co-ordinator of the washing up rota, which everyone HATES and standing out in the freezing cold on playground duty, during my coffee break when it's 'Tank's' turn to be playground monitor. He plays by his own rules and woebetide anyone who gets in his way. Talk about setting me up to fail. 6. Spent twenty minutes of the afternoon sitting in the visitors room, nextdoor to the Head Teach's office tyring to pursuade 'Tank Boy!' to do his spelling test.That was, until I hit upon a lightbulb of an idea. 7. Five minutes after that he was sitting back in class attempting the test and no longer trying to cause the rest of the class any disturbance. 8. A crowd of stunned, gobsmacked faces filled the classroom.They just couldn't understand how I had tamed the wild beast, and perhaps they never will.9. An unopened packet of custard creams makes the perfect bribe.It doesn't take an Einstein to work out the mind of a delinquent child. He just needs that 'little extra' to help him make those all too vital descisions in his mixed up life. His biscuits may not last the whole week, but 'Tank' has promised he'll be good 'until Friday'. We'll have to wait and see on that one. 10. Went home on a high after being hailed the 'Miracle Worker!'Mr Green was particularly impressed with my performance and asked me if I would be interested in taking the higher level teaching assistant course. I said I would definitely think about it. Who knows what the future may hold. But for now, I live in the present. That being, what to wear tonight. I think it's time to get out my pink suit. You know, the one I wore for the interview. It may just bring me luck again.Will it? You'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out! For now, I'm signing off. Got to finish getting myself 'all spruced up' as my dad used to say. We're meeting at nine, in The White Horse down the road. Wish me luck!* Site of the day - First Date Bible.

Mr Blue's Truncheon!  
How to lie...Interested in self-improvement? Then check out my new side column, especially planned for those who have something to hide. Here's a little taster...Please forgive me for sounding a bit dizzy this evening. Yesterday I spent ages on the computer, updating my site-------------> (Look to your right!)I've got the bags under my eyes to prove it. There's also a distinct lack of caffeine in the house.I found the above site yesterday as I was searching for 'self help' sites for those with indentity problems, like me. You'd be surprised what you can find!Some top tips for anyone who, as in my position, needs to lie a lot! I've met one of the writers who used to work for the CIA, (induction training) so they know what they are talking about. Whether you believe them, is another story!Anyway, with my homework complete I turned on the telly, only to watch a programme about how to cheat the Lie Detector.I'd love to take the test, as an experiment, to see if I have it all under control. Could they tell when I lied if my brain was telling me I wasn't? With Ms White (aka the office b&w cow) on the 'smiley' warpath, I decided it was high time to do a little 'identity research'. Making sure I knew my background story, memorising my well thought out 'where I came from'and 'where I worked previously' etc. It pays to be on top form when your dealing with the public eye. I need to act confident in everything I do, as to not arouse suspicion. It's all in the details, as the above website will confirm. I also had a long, long chat with Mr Blue, yesterday. Being so busy surfing etc I never even left the house all weekend. In turn this also meant I forgot to 'sign in' at the local police station. I've only failed to report in once before and it didn't take long for Janine (the switchboard operator) to call me to check everything was ok. When I told Mr Blue how Janine hadn't rung to remind me he told me it was alright, as long as I was 'seen' by him, he'd report back. In fact, according to him, I do not have to check in anymore. Apparently, I am no longer on the 'A List' (those in most danger). Now I have a job and have settled down in my new life they seem to have lost interest in me. Which is a bit worrying. In my eyes nothing has changed. I'm still the same person inside. My parents are not coming back and my life is still in enough danger that the police have not reclaimed my panic alarm or given me my old life back. This morning however, I woke up feeling ab fab and raring to go! I've binned the dreaded teasmade from hell; using my mobile phone alarm instead. Works like a dream. Cool! So, is this why I am feeling so good?Nope!Have I won the pools?Nah!Did I have 'a friend' round to 'stay' last night? All night long? Maybe...Was it Mr Blue?YES! YES! YES! and...Well, let's just say that Mr Green is not the only one with a wide girth!(I think the post title gave it away a bit).
