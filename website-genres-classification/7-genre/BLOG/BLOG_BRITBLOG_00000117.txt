The Once and Future Slacker…

Sign me up I volunteer! 
Pre-haircut Originally uploaded by Bamfu. The sitcom continues: it's just not as funny...I have a small little feeling that my mind is constantly going over while I am at work: I don't think the other co-workers like me much. Barring the owner of the company who hired me (who was raving to my coworkers about my writing: this could have something to do with what I've been thinking about) I really don't think the others like me much. I'm just the awkwardly dressed white boy in the office. I mean it's been so long since I have dressed up that it just seems out of place. I miss my slacker style of shorts and a tee-shirt.Another thing: I feel that my first amendment rights are being infringed upon. Everyone at the office (all like 7 of them, excluding me) is uberly-religious, or seemingly so at the morning prayer circle. Now I am one to welcome a 15 to 30 minute break each morning, but I feel that something along these lines shouldn't be mandatory. I mean I don't care what a person believes but when it's forced upon me, then I damn well do care. Maybe I'll hide myself away in the bathroom right before they start so they can't find me, and I can avoid an awkward confrontation, which could cost me my job.Thursday night I was still a little on the down-trodden side. granted I did enjoy the episode of The OC (which always brings a small smile to my face), but still I was even excited about the prospect of a four day weekend (I feel that this is the one sweet fact to my job).Friday was a little better, the weather was freaking beautiful, one of those rare Houston days where the temperature isn't too high, but it's just high enough to be nice out. I refused to be cooped up inside the house. I hopped on my bike and headed out to the library (the only indoor thing I had to do, a book was going to be overdue if I didn't high tail it there first). I spent little to no time in the library, too many little children there due to the last day of spring break, so it wasn't the usual quiet I like.After the library, I headed out to some indoor and outdoor batting cages that I just recently found near the library. I spent quite a bit of time getting some frustration out with a good bit of batting practice. Lastly I stopped at these baseball fields (yesterday was a lonely baseball oriented day) that are near my house and proceeded to practice a little pitching. There is just something very gratifying about throwing a baseball.Okay this post has gone on for way to long, I'll write more later. Maybe tomorrow or monday, we'll see.

What? 
Im_Sorry_Im_Going_To_Have_To_Ask_You_To_Step_Away_From_The_President Originally uploaded by Bamfu. Hmm... something is amiss, I must ask a favor of my loyal readership (that's you!). Work is fine. Like I have no big qualms about work, but something strange is happening. When I get home each and every day I am just depressed. Like I have no appetite, I can't really sleep when I get home it's all just weird. So I gotta know, is this normal for starting a 9 to 6 job, or am I just weird, so I need some suggestions as to what I can do.Did any of that just make sense?

Hmm... 
Art Originally uploaded by Bamfu. So I bet you're wondering how my first day was. About one third of the day was fun, those were the hours I worked where I had my cool job title. The other two thirds of my day were spent working with my crappy job title in place. The crappy job title doesn't have an actual title but I choose to call him "Clerical Lad". I hate "Clerical Lad" even though his secret identity is me, I still hate him. His computer work is boring and quite redundant. I hate "Clerical Lad" he can go and fu... I mean.The other guy, with the official job title of "Publicist" is badass. I mean badass! His job encompasses meeting the talent and then writing about them, and then talking to newspapers and magazines and the like about the artist and the article (which I would have written). Publicist guy is awesome, I love Publicist guy, publicist guy (who is me) can please me any day... I mean. Feh, I'm actually exhausted, it's the first time in a long time.

"Well she turned me into a newt!" 
Lizard Originally uploaded by Bamfu. "I got better."So my last post was powerfully ineffective, I got lots of comments but not really what I was looking for."Texas hasn't had a major earthquake in over a 150 years, we're due" - I love Hank Hill's logic. The house next door to ours is up for sale or rent and I want someone like Hank Hill to move in (well maybe Boomhauer, especially since I have never heard anyone speak like that, and I have lived in Texas all my life and pretty much been everywhere in the state, except the panhandle; I've never been to the panhandle).Edit (March 7th): I got a job. Now it's only a part time job (I work on Tuesday's, Wednesday's, and Thursdays) but its a totally phat job. I was originally supposed to digitizing all of their documents, but instead I got a much better position of sorts. The place is an independent (very independent) music company, they search out talent in the Houston area and start to represent them. Well when I went in this morning I was going through a compulsory interview (I already was assured the job) and the head of the company asked what I like to do, and I talked about wanting to write freelance, and about the screenplays. So she was like "alright, follow me". She gave me a pen, a pad and some paper and lead me into their 'studio". This college aged kid was in there singing and she stopped him, introduced me and pretty much had me ask alot of questions ofhim, and I sat and listened to his answers and then heard him sing. After the interview and the singing, she took me to a small office (which I think might end up being mine) and she said "Write". And that was that. I was nervous at first, because I was given little to no instruction, I just had my notes and the request to write. And so I did. I busted out this article about how the kid sings and how his voice is a new thing for the R&B scene (I'll explain the R&B in a minute) and I printed out the rough copy, gave it to her, and she was like "Okay, you're in". BAM! I'm an intern.So it's funny, this job should prove to be a pretty good amount of experience in what I would like to do in the future (and the boss knows all of these contacts in LA who are always on the lookout for fresh meat in the writing department) but what really makes my job so funny is that I am the only, I mean the only white person working there. I love it. It's an awesome thing when I'm the lamest person at the workplace. In fact I think I ought to write a sitcom pilot about this, white guy in a black recording studio; the UPN would buy it right?

What the fuck?!? 
I suppose it's time for me to don my deerstalker cap, start playing my violin and hit up an opium den cause I have some Sherlocking to do. My last post mysteriously disappeared. That's right it vanished into thin air, I did nothing to that post which would have made it go away but there it is: gone. So here is the gist of it: A. I got the Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD's from the library (I have since watched all the episodes, my favorite was the moonenite episode.) B. Tony Hillerman mysteries. C. My boredom and ways in which I feel that I should solve that boredom. 1. By correspondence, email me and maybe I'll write you a letter... Oh real mail! 2. Question asking: it's like a mock press conference except I am infinitely more exciting then Iraq. Plus I'll answer your question here in this very weblog, making you famous (to the ten people who read this). 3. You tell me, I'll take suggestions for what you think I should do. Involve yourself if you want, longdistance phone call, photo stream featuring me eating, whatever you want I bet I can provide... (oh except telling me to get a job, stop making me conform to your bourgeois lifestyle.)That's it. I hope I can find my old post. It was more articulate and had a picture of turtles.

I'm way to old for this. 
Is_This_Going_To_Hurt Originally uploaded by Bamfu. Oy. I forget what it was like to be young. I say this of course after getting back from a concert. We went to see Motion City Soundtrack and Matchbook Romance tonight, I'm going to have to say that I like Motion City better, and am currently trying to find the album online (for download of course, who do you think I am: a working, functional member of society... hahaha jokes on you). The show itself was rocking, but I hate the idea of feeling like one of the oldest people in the crowd (barring the parents in the back who were with their children...)Oh some fucker jabbed me in the back with his elbow, the jokes on him though cause in the process I got him in the sternum...I had quite a few people today ask me to throw them on top of the crowd, and since I find it very amusing I obliged and chunked those little punk-kids up...I'm old.

Everytime I try so hard I get nothing, nothing... 
I_Steal_Childrens_Souls_at_Night Originally uploaded by Bamfu. I just got finished reading this book. Planet Simpson by Chris Turner, is a side-splitting good yarn about America's favorite family. Discussing how the Simpson's have taken their seat at the head of the pop-cultural table. It's an interesting look at how each family member epitomizes some facet of American society (and in some cases British Punk society). Anyone who counts themselves among the fans of The Simpsons (which as far as I know should be just about every person in the world...) should read this book.I'm still in my funk, and its being helped along by the fact that I just finished Planet Simpson and have nothing on my book list. Come on people I don't want to have to resort to playing sports again; I need some book suggestions once again.I'm not in the least bit handy, however without fail whenever my dad starts a project around the house (this time its repairing a broken motor in a laundry dryer) I'm always called on to be his stumbling assistant. I don't know shit about any of these things, and I'm not absorbing anything, I'd just call a repairperson... because at least I stand a 50/50 chance of getting some hot female repairwoman and the dryer repair turns into some campy 70's porn.
