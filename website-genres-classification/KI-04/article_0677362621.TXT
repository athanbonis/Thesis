Generating Simple URLs for Search Engines  
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Search engines generally use robot crawlers to locate searchable pages on web sites and intranets (robots are also called crawlers, spiders, gatherers or harvesters). These robots, which use the same requests and responses as web browsers, read pages and follow links on those pages to locate every page on the specified servers. 

Dynamic URLs

Search engine robots follow standard links with slashes, but dynamic pages, generated from databases or content management systems, have dynamic URLs with question marks (?) and other command punctuation such as &, %, + and $. 

Here's an example of a dynamic URL which queries a database with specific parameters to generate a page:

http://store.britannica.com/escalate/store/CategoryPage?
 pls=britannica&bc=britannica&clist=03258f0014009f&cc
 =eb_online&startNum=0&rangeNum=15

All those elements in the URL? They're parameters to the program that generates the page. You probably don't even need most of them.

Here is a theoretical version of that URL rewritten in a simple form: 

http://store.britannica.com/Cat/B-online/03258f0014009f/s0-e15/

If you look at Amazon's URLs, you'll see they contain no indication to a robot that they're pointing into a database, but of course they are.

Problems with Dynamic URLs

Some public search engines and most site and intranet search engines will index URLs with dynamic URLS, but others will not. And because it's difficult to link to these pages, they will be penalized by engines which use link analysis to improve relevance ranking, such as Google's PageRank algorithm. In Summer 2003, Google had very few dynamic URL pages in the first 10 pages of results for test searches. 

When pages are hidden behind a form, they are even less accessible to search spiders. For example, Internet Yellow Pages sites often require users to type a business name and city. For a search engine to index these pages requires special-case programming to fill in those fields. Most webwide search engines will simply skip the content. This is sometimes referred to as the "deep web" or the "invisible web" -- valuable content pages that are invisible to search engine robots, (internal and external), do not get indexed and therefore can't be found by potential customers and users.

Search engine robot writers are concerned about their robot programs getting lost on web sites with infinite listings. Search engine developers call these "spider traps" or "black holes" -- sites where each page has links to many more programmatically-generated pages, without any useful content on them. The classic example is a calendar that keeps going forward through the 21st Century, although it has no events set after this year. This can cause the search engine to waste time and effort, or even crash your server.

Readable URLs are good for more than being found by local and webwide search engine robots. Humans feel more comfortable with consistent and intuitive paths, recognizing the date or product name in the URL. 

Finally, by abstracting the public version of the URL, it will not be dependent on the backend software. If your site changes from Perl to Java or from CFM to .Net, the URLs will not change, so all links to your pages will remain live. 

Static Page Generation or URL Rewriting?

The simplest solution is to generate static pages from your dynamic data and store them in the file system, linking to them using simple URLs. Site visitors and robots can access these files easily. This also removes a load from your back end database, as it does not have to gather content every time someone wants to view a page. This process is particularly appropriate for web sites or sections with archival data, such as journal back issues, old press releases, information on obsolete products, and so on. 

For rapidly-changing information, such as news, product pages with inventory, special offers, or web conferencing, you should set up automatic conversion system. Most servers have a filter that can translate incoming URLs with slashes to internal URLs with question marks -- this is called URL rewriting. 

For either system, you must make sure that of the rewritten pages has at least one incoming link. Search engine robots will follow these links, and index your page. 

If you have database access forms, dynamic menus, Java, JavaScript or Flash links, you should set up a system to generate listings with entries for everything in your database. This can be chronological, alphabetical, but product ID, or any other order that suits you. Search engine robots can only follow links they can find, so be sure to keep this listing up to date.

URL Rewriting and Relative Link Problems

Pages which include images and links to other pages should use relative links from the root rather than from the current page. This is because the browser sends a request for each image by putting together the host and domain name (www.example.com) with the relative link (images/design44.gif). This is based on the Unix file name conventions of current directory, child and parent (../) directories. Because URL rewriting mimics directory path structures, it confuses the browsers.

If your original file linked to the local imagesdirectory, then rewritten the link would break. 

Original URL for this page

www.example.com/prod=?int+7=2&2&4

Rewritten URL looks like this

www.example.com/prod/int/7/224/

If the relative link to the dynamic location images directory would be:

dyn/images/design44.gif

in the rewritten path, this would be interpreted as

www.example.com/prod/int/7/224/dyn/images/design44.gif

instead of the correct path, which would be something like this:

www.example.com/dyn/images/design44.gif

Because the path to the images subdirectory is wrong, the image is lost.

Solution One: Use Absolute Links

To avoid confusion, use links that start at the host root, that means paths which all start at the main directory of your site. A slash at the start tells the browser that it should not try to find things in the local directory, but just put the host name and the path together. The disadvantage is that if you move or change the directory hierarchy, you'll need to change every link which includes that path.

Using the same example above, change the relative (local) link within the generated page from this:

images/design44.gif

to an absolute link that points at the correct directory:

/dyn/images/design44.gif

Similarly, a link to a page in a related directory (either static or rewritten)

perpetualmotion/moreinfo.html

Would require the entire path:

/prod/int/perpetualmotion/moreinfo.html

Note that if you change the directory name from "prod" to "products" or take the "int" directory out of the hierarchy, you'll have to change every one of those URLs.

Solution Two: Rewrite the Links Dynamically

Using a mechanism like URL rewriting, you can generate a path to the correct directory and program your server to create absolute links within the pages as it's generating them. 

For example, if all the images are in the directory 

www.example.com/dyn/images/

You could create a variable with the path "/dyn/images/" and the server would put that before all the relative urls to images.

Checking URLs on Your Site

1.  Perform a sanity check - make sure that your site does not generate infinite information. For example, if you have a calendar, see if it shows pages for years far in the future. If it does, set limits.
 
2.  Generate pages or Choose and implement a URL rewriting system - see below for articles and products.
 

3.  Check relative links for images and other pages.
 

4.  Create automatic link list pages so there are links to the pages generated dynamically.
 

5.  Test with your browser.
 

6.  Test with a robot You can use a linkchecker, local search crawler or site mapping tool to make sure these URLs work properly, don't have duplicates, and don't generate infinite loops.

URL Rewriting Tools

* Apache 

* Apache mod_rewrite documentation - canonical documentation 
* A Users Guide to URL Rewriting with the Apache Webserver - useful but does not quite explain the general case. 
* Module mod_rewrite Tutorial - Part 3 explains how to convert dynamic URLs to simple ones 
* Search Engine Friendly URLs with mod_rewrite - (April 2003) - simple instructions, very clear. 

* Perl 

* Using the environment variables Path_Info and Script_Name provides access to the dynamic URL including the "query string" (the part after the question mark). Converting the query information into a single code and adding it to the path creates a static URL. 

* PHP 

* see articles above, especially the one on Using ForceType, and PortalPageFilter below 

* Microsoft IIS and Active Server Pages (ASP) 
These filters recognize slash-delimited URLs and convert them to internal formats before the server gets them. 

* ASPSpiderBait - package converts the PATH_INFO part of an HTTP header request: the user doesn't see the punctuation, just placeholder letters. The filter replaces the placeholders with punctuation them before the server can see them. $100 per server. 
* ISAPI_Rewrite - IIS ISAPI filter written in C/C++, simple rule for dynamic conversion. Lite version is free, Full version, single server, $46, enterprise license, $418 
* IISRewrite - IIS filter, works much like mod_rewrite, examples include converting dynamic to simple URLs. $199.00 per server 
* PortalPageFilter - a high-priority C++ ISAPI filter for ASP 
* XQASP - high-performance NT IIS C++ or Unix Java filter for ASP. $99 to $2,100 depending on scope 

* ColdFusion (CFM) 

* May have an option to reconfigure the setup, replacing the ? with a / 
* Use the Fusebox framework, <cf_formurl2attributessearch>tag.
