Is this really a wise decision, especially when the budget deficit is spiraling out of control?Peace Through UnderstadingDan -------------------- "I distrust those people who know sowell what God wants them to do becauseI notice it always coincides withtheir own desires."---Susan B.

But still I would like to see this happen...here's why.Right now a manned mission to mars is impossible because you must have a ship large enough to store enough oxygen and fuel to make the trip to mars and back. Right now that is impossible. So, in order to complete this mission think of all the new technology that will have to be created.First, we would have to learn of a fail-proof way of reusing the breathing air for an infinite amount of time.Second, we would have to create or discover a new fuel source that is smaller and lighter. Plus maybe even a way of creating fuel from sometype of mineral or something that we could find on mars so we could create our own fuel to make it back to earth. Also we would need a new propulsion system. JFK wanted to walk on the moon, but he also knew what would have to happen in order to get the job done...the same with Bush, it's not so much the footprint in Mars soil that he is looking forward to, but all the great inventions or materials that will profit not just America, but all of Mankind forever. Now that's a vision...even if we have a budget defecit for a few more years. -------------------- "Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men."

There is little if any comparison between JFK's 'man on the moon within the decade' goal and George's announcement. When JFK set his manned lunar landing target, the US was involved in a very heated cold war with the Soviets. When Sputnik convinced the world that we were lagging in technology, we were frankly scared (and humiliated). There were fears that the Soviets might use their advantage for military or strategic purposes (maybe moon-based nukes sound far fetched, but this was the nervous 60's). True, there was an element of furthering knowledge but that was secondary in many ways. Oh, and the cost was somewhat more reasonable.George's plan smells more like a campaign scheme designed to make him look more Kennedy-ish by appealing to young voters and intellectuals (the need to reach out there may be great!). Not bad for someone who previously regarded Mars and the Milky Way as candy bars. (Just kiddin) Not that I blame him.. when you are President, you can propose all kinds of wondrous things and many other candidates would try something like that too. Is it true he nominated Paul ONeill to helm the first mission?

They will take this mission on and complete it and the world will be a better place because of it and when my children open up their history books and begin to learn of the Mars landing, I will be able to tell them all about it. -------------------- "Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men."

You think the guys with PhDs are going to be out there using the welding torches and riviters? I totally agree with mikey...If not the US now, someone else will later on. Isn't that what made America what it is, people pushing themselves t be the best no matter what and always stiving the be ahead of everyone else in the world. America was built on sweat, blood and tears, not sitting around waiting for another country to do it first then us copy it. -------------------- "Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men."

In this economy, they indeed may! However, the ratio of technical employees to skilled or unskilled hourly labor in a strictly developmental project like this will be 200:1 for years and years until (and if) the new spacecraft are in production.I am fully supportive of furthering science and for America being on the cutting edge. It's a matter of timing- we're in a very deep hole with the deficit and it's getting deeper and deeper.. it seems an odd time to look for ways to spend huge amounts of money on (admirable, but) non-essential projects.

I going to sound a little bias but for instance Georgia State has a 600 million dollar (and that was in 1999) master plan (Georgia State Master Plan) for development that includes new buildings and renovations to current ones. Georgia Tech just completed "technology park" which was part of a similiar plan and UGA also has a plan too. We could use these funds to help build projects similar to these. Of course this just isnt limited to colleges and universities but for high schools, middle schools, elemantery schools. Even beyond educational institutions and into more traditional goverment funded sectors like transportation.I agree this is the year 2004 and by now I was expecting to be riding in flying cars and maybe living on some bio-dome on the moon after I graduate (courtesy of watching to much of the Jetsons). And Im not against this idea whatsoever. I think we should invest some money into it to get it started of course and then see how is it going from there and base future funding decisions on that. It should also be noted that by this time next year the economy could be improving, and two years from now we could be revisiting the boom times of the late '90s. But once again we could be in the economic dumps again within 5 years or so, the economy moves in cycles and a project like this may go through many economic cycles. -------------------- - Student - Georgia State University - Political Science (Pre-Law) & Policy Studies (Planning and Economic Development).- President - Georgia State University - Pre-Law Club. - Staff Writer - Georgia State University - Signal.- Crazy Georgia State Basketball Fan.- aka GSU Mens BB Fan or GaStPanthers

The money that would be wasted going to the moon could be used for our fragile Education system and fising those dumb "No Child Lefy Behind" tests.

Just days after the space exploration announcement by Bush came a press piece saying Bush would seek $1.5 Billion (omigawd) for "Defense of Marriage". I'm beginning to think the space initiative will actually consist of the Republicans shipping unwed mothers out to Mars and beyond.
