Frequently Asked Questions
 
IX. FORBES.COM PORTFOLIO TRACKER

A. Creating a Portfolio in the Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker
 

Q. Why am I taken to a membership page when I go to the portfolio page? 

A. In order to use the Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker, you must be a Forbes.com member. It is very easy and it's free. Just create a membership name and password at the following link. 

B. Advantage of using the Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker
 

Q. What does the Portfolio Tracker offer me? 

A. Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker gives you the chance to gather competitive information, manage investments or conduct research on business prospects by allowing you to monitor companies, stocks and funds with this powerful research and tracking tool. To read more, please click here. 

C. Adding Symbols
 

Q. How do I add stock or mutual fund symbols to my existing Tracker? 

A. If you wish to add symbols to your current portfolio tracker, all you have to do is click on "Add Symbols," which can be found within your portfolio page. 

D. The limit of holdings per portfolio
 

Q. How many symbols can I enter into one portfolio? 

A. You can add up to 25 stocks or fund symbols per portfolio in the Forbes.com tracker. However, an unlimited number of portfolios can be created. 

E. Default View
 

Q. What is a default view for my Portfolio Tracker? 

A. The default view gives you the option to view your tracker in a portfolio format or a Watchlist format. Use the Portfolio View to display information about the number of shares you've bought and the prices you paid for them, or select the Watchlist view as a simple monitor for stocks or mutual funds. 

F. Creating a new View
 

Q. How does the View feature work? 

A. The View feature allows you to customize your portfolio to visually suit you. You can have up to 15 different columns in your View as well as choose from 38 different investment criteria headers for your columns. Just follow the simple directions below to achieve this: 

1. Go to your portfolio. 

2. Click the "CREATE" link by the View pull-down menu located immediately above your portfolio on the right-hand side. 

3. Now choose a name for your new portfolio View 

4. Select the information you wish to display in each column. 

You can have up to 15 different columns in your View. There are 38 different investment criteria to choose from for the columns. 

G. Adding additional shares of an existing holding
 

Q. How do I add additional shares of a stock that I currently own? 

A. The way to do this would be the same steps taken to add the purchase of a new stock. Click "ADD SYMBOLS." Enter the stock info. Click "ADD THESE SYMBOLS." The extra purchase will appear as a separate entry in the portfolio tracker. There's no way to "ADD MORE SHARES" of a purchased stock without going through the drill of entering a whole new purchase. Unfortunately, in the current implementation of the Forbes.com portfolio tracker, you cannot have the portfolio average purchase prices for different lots. 

H. Recording sales of a stock
 

Q. If I sell a stock, how can I record the sale in my portfolio? 

A. Since recording a sale removes or modifies a holding from your portfolio, we suggest editing your Portfolio. Click "EDIT THIS PORTFOLIO." If you sold your entire holding of a specific stock you can, in this edit screen, click the checkbox under the DELETE column for the holding you sold, then click the SAVE CHANGES button. If you only sold part of your holding, then you would just need to update the number of shares to reflect the amount you have left after the sale. 

I. Tracking Splits
 

Q. How do I track splits with the Forbes.com portfolio tracker? 

A. Follow these simple instructions to track your splits. 

1. First, you have to see if the stock has split. If yes, then you need to check what the ratio is (for example, 2-for-1 stock split, 3-for-2, etc.) To check for stock splits, you can use our quote box on the Forbes.com home page and select Quote Page from the pull-down menu. At the bottom of the Quote Page, in the Equity notes in the footer, you can see if the stock recently had a stock split. 

2. Then, you need to adjust the number of shares in your portfolio accordingly to account for the stock split. For example, if you have 10 shares and the company has a 2-for-1 stock split, you will now have twice as many shares, i.e. 20 shares. 

The price of the shares is automatically adjusted the day the split occurs by the exchange so, as long as your share info is correct, all should be fine. 

J. Partial Shares
 

Q. How do I enter partial shares of my stocks into my portfolio? 

A. Forbes.com portfolio tracker does not currently accept partial shares of stocks, only whole numbers. So we suggest that you round the number of share to the closest whole number but just be aware that this will not give you accurate totals. 

K. Shorting a stock
 

Q. Can I record a short position with this tracker? 

A. This feature is currently unavailable. 

L. Money Market Funds and Cash Entries
 

Q. Why are my money market funds and cash entries not working in my portfolios? 

A. Forbes.com portfolio tracker currently can not track these features. 

M. Mutual Fund Dividend Reinvestments
 

Q. How do I enter a Mutual Fund Dividend Reinvestment? 

A. The way to enter a mutual fund dividend reinvestment would be to enter another purchase of the mutual fund. Since the portfolio allows you to enter fractional shares of mutual fund purchases, the only downside would be having a long list of the same mutual fund. 

To do this, click "ADD SYMBOLS" on the portfolio screen. Then enter the information [symbol, price, shares, etc] and click "ADD THESE SYMBOLS." 

N. Class A and B Stock
 

Q. Why does BRK.B continuously show up as N/A in my portfolio? 

A. Unfortunately, in the current implementation of the Forbes.com portfolio tracker, you cannot track class A and B stock. This means you cannot track stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.a or BRK.b), Liberty Media (LMG.a or LMG.b), Conoco Inc. (COC.a or COC.b) or Raytheon (RTN.B). We do apologize for this inconvenience. You can, however, get a quote using the above stock symbols in our quote box, which is located on the top left of the Forbes.com home page. 

O. Mutual Fund Prices
 

Q. Why is Forbes.com Mutual Fund price not matching other sites prices? 

A. Our mutual fund prices do not update until 3AM ET the morning after the close of the market. So for that reason, Mutual Fund prices will not be reflected until the following day. 

P. E-mail Alert for Stock on My Tracker
 

Q. Can I receive e-mail alerts about specific stocks or funds in my portfolio tracker? 

A. Currently, we do not offer an alert feature within the Forbes.com portfolio tracker. We are considering adding this feature at some point. 

However, you can obtain news about a specific stock by using our People Tracker. 

You can, for example, add the CEO of the company you wish to follow. In the E-MAIL ALERTS settings, you can chose to receive news about the company and/or the CEO. 

Q. Printing my Portfolio
 

Q. How can I completely print my portfolio and not have half of it cut off? 

A. To successfully print the Portfolio View list, you must print the portfolio in its landscape mode. To do this, you should click the pull-down menu FILE in your browser and then select "PRINT." On the print screen, click "PROPERTIES." Under Orientation, you should then select the "LANDSCAPE" button then click "OK" and finally click "OK" in the Print screen. This will print the portfolio in landscape mode and will print the entire Portfolio View. 

R. Closed End Mutual Funds
 

Q. Does the Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker accept Closed End Mutual Fund ticker symbols? 

A. At this time this feature is not available on the Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker 

S. Bonds and Convertible Securities
 

Q. Can Bond or Convertible Securities be tracked if I enter them into my portfolio? 

A. At this time we do not carry this feature. 

T. Logging out of the Portfolio

Q. How do I log out of the systems so that others that use my computer don't have access to my portfolio? 

A. Once you have finished using your Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker for the day, we do recommend that you log out of Forbes.com. 

To log out, please do the following: 

1. Go back to the homepage of the Forbes.com Web site. 

2. On the left hand side of your screen, scroll down until you see "FREE MEMBERSHIP." 

3. Under this title in blue letters, the last option is "MY PROFILE". 

4. Please click on "MY PROFILE" and you will see "EDIT MY PROFILE", then EMAIL, ZIP CODE, CHANGE PASSWORD and last but not least "LOG OUT." 

5. Please click on log out. 

6. You are now logged out of your Forbes.com Portfolio Tracker and will have to use your member name and password to view it again.
