and finally 10.THE VOTES MUST BE HONESTLY COUNTED.

Fred, are you implying that the initial standard vote count in 2000, following all the laws of the land as typically is usual in modern US election history, was not "honestly counted?"

That would certainly be a new charge.

Or are you just whining again that the manufactured extralegal varied inconsistent recounts and threats of recounts in 2000 did not give up the count result you would have preferred?

Hans Blix was Inspector Clouseau, the bungling detective in the Pink Panther flicks. 

Right-o and the UN, Old Europe and multilateralism (except with North Korea of course LOL) were dead concepts in the face of the US' military might.

Now we're hiding behind China's skirts, begging the UN to justify our plans for Iraq, saying that we can't defeat the insurgency militarily, sending Baker to beg his old cronies in Old Europe for debt relief...OMG.

For the millionth time, no one liked SH except for those who profited from him. Can you not understand this concept? He was a murderous despot helped along...by us.

CNN 7/17/02

"...RITTER: No, the U.N. presented a report saying they could not account for everything.... 

RITTER: Well, look: As of December 1998 we had accounted for 90 to 95 percent of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability -- "we" being the weapons inspectors. We destroyed all the factories, all of the means of production and we couldn't account for some of the weaponry, but chemical weapons have a shelf-life of five years. Biological weapons have a shelf-life of three years. To have weapons today, they would have had to rebuild the factories and start the process of producing these weapons since December 1998....

RITTER: We don't, but we cannot go to war on guesswork, hypothesis and speculation. We go to war on hardened fact. So Tony Blair says he has a dossier; present the dossier. George W. Bush and his administration say they know with certainty; show us how you know.... 

RITTER: I have never said that Iraq was fully co-operating and when I make an assessment about Iraq's disarmament level, it has nothing to do with what Iraq has declared. I do not trust them, I take nothing they say at face value, it is based upon on the hard work of weapons inspectors who have verified that Iraq has been disarmed through their own independent sources...

RITTER: I believe Washington D.C. is using the concept of inspections as a political foil to justify war. America doesn't want to inspectors to return. The best way to stop war is to get the inspectors back in. I believe it should be the policy of the United Nations to get the inspectors back in."

In the last 3 years Shrubbery has raised federal spending by 25%. 

Unbelieveable. Conservatives (which Shrubbery et al are not) are up in arms against the "drunken sailors" in Congress and the admin. 

The Dems, yes those who balanced the budget, have lousy PR on this issue but are better with the books than the Reps are. 

I think Stossel is simple-minded and outright misleading from time to time but these are stats:

"...But for more than 75 years, no Republican administration has cut the size of government. Since George W. Bush became president, government spending has risen nearly 25 percent. 

And the spending increase isn't just tied to the war on terrorism. The Office of Management and Budget says spending at the Environmental Protection Agency is up 12 percent, it's up 14 percent at the Agriculture Department, 30 percent at the Department of the Interior, 64 percent at the Department of Labor, and 70 percent at the Department of Education...."

Bush thinks he knows what's good for you, and he'll spend money to prove it

http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...

There's barely a speech by President Bush that doesn't cite the glories of human freedom. It's God's gift to mankind, he believes. And in some ways this President has clearly expanded it: the people of Afghanistan and Iraq enjoy liberties unimaginable only a few years ago. But there's a strange exception to this Bush doctrine. It ends when you reach America's shores. Within the U.S., the Bush Administration has shown an unusually hostile attitude toward the exercise of personal freedom. When your individual choices conflict with what the Bush people think is good for you, they have been only too happy to intervene. The government, Bush clearly believes, has a right to be involved in many personal decisions you make 혰 punishing some, encouraging others, nudging and prodding the public to live the good life as the President understands it. The nanny state, much loved by Democrats, is thriving under Republicans. 

Just recall Bush's State of the Union address last week. People used to ridicule President Clinton's laundry list of micro-initiatives. But Bush is no different. Where once education was essentially the preserve of states, school principals and parents, this President has expanded the federal role in unprecedented ways. The No Child Left Behind Act holds states and localities accountable for meeting educational standards in order to qualify for federal funds. No wonder Ted Kennedy originally signed on.

In his speech, the President unveiled millions of dollars to randomly test high school kids for drug use. He is doubling the federal money currently spent to admonish teens to practice sexual abstinence. He is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on antidrug propaganda and sending federal agents to bust pot clubs for those using medical marijuana to ease the pain of crippling diseases. Republican Senators are even trying to withhold federal funding from states that allow medical-marijuana ads on public transport. These are not unrelated measures. The President is proud of his Big Government moralism. As he put it in his first State of the Union message, "Values are important, so we have tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, but right from wrong." Sounds inoffensive enough. But who exactly determines what is right and what is wrong? Churches? Synagogues? Parents? Teachers? Nah. The Federal Government. 

Once upon a time, Republicans believed in leaving it to the private and voluntary sectors to do the important work of building citizenship and values. Remember the "thousand points of light"? These days those lightbulbs need government subsidies. One of the key beliefs of this President is that federal money should be funneled to religious groups that blend proselytizing with important social work. His faith-based initiative largely withered on the vine, but he has done what he can. In last year's State of the Union message, he proposed almost half a billion dollars to pay for mentors for disadvantaged high school students or the children of prisoners. This year he proposed an extensive government program to coach newly released ex-cons into better lives. Ever wonder who these government-backed mentors are? And what exactly they're preaching? Maybe you should, because you're paying for them. 

States' rights? Only if the states do what the President believes in. How else to explain the vast expansion of federal power that the Partial Birth Abortion Act entailed, limiting the rights of states to regulate abortion as they see fit? On medical marijuana, the Bush doctrine has led to federal agents' overruling state laws that tolerate the use of pot for medicinal purposes. Gay marriage? The Bush Administration is close to backing a federal constitutional amendment that would overrule any state that decided to give marriages 혰 or even civil unions and domestic partnerships 혰 to gays. States' rights are all well and good 혰 as long as the states don't do things that some Republicans disapprove of. 

Want to lose weight using ephedra? You can't. Bush's FDA has banned the over-the-counter supplement. Steroids? You heard the Nanny in Chief. And if you're a scientist researching a touchy subject, be prepared to feel the breath of Big Government down the back of your white coat. Early on in his Administration, the President 혰 not scientists or patients 혰 decided exactly how far federally funded research into stem cells could go. Cloning technologies? Forget about it. 

There has always been a tension in conservatism between those who favor more liberty and those who want more morality. But what's indisputable is that Bush's "compassionate conservatism" is a move toward the latter 혰 the use of the government to impose and subsidize certain morals over others. He is fusing Big Government liberalism with religious-right moralism. It's the nanny state with more cash. Your cash, that is. And their morals.

Laangaan... Excellent post.

Here's what they should have been looking for. It's been reported by 60 Minutes that Halliburton is one of several companies that has been working closely with countries that support terrorism.

Getting shrill and defensive are we? 

Are you?

ROTFLMAO. 

Sitting in my chair shaking my head in amazement at your persistent foolishness.

Understand now? Geez.

So it's my little aside about the President closing down Saddam's torture romper room that got you all charged up.
