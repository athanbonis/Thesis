Back to top Power Search Tips Boolean Operations: Keyword Search Action AND Finds only documents containing all of the specified words or phrases. Sonny AND Cher finds documents with both the word Sonny and the word Cher, not necessarily next to each other. OR Finds documents containing at least one of the specified words or phrases. Los Angeles OR New York finds documents containing either Los Angeles OR New York. The documents found could contain both, but might only contain one. NOT Excludes documents containing the specified word or phrase. Artisan AND NOT Blair Witch finds documents with Artisan but not containing Blair Witch. NOT cannot stand alone--use it with another operator, like AND. For example, the search does not accept Disney NOT Eisner ; instead, specify Disney AND NOT Eisner . NEAR Finds documents containing both specified words or phrases within 10 words of each other. Sony NEAR video would probably find documents related to the Sony's home video or video gaming industries, but likely not corporate announcements or computer hardware. Case Sensitivity: Use only lower case unless you want your search to be case sensitive. If you search for Fox , you'll get only documents that include that word with just that capitalization. If you search for fox , you'll get any page with that word. Grouping Use parentheses ( ) to specify grouping in a query. For example, to search for documents that contain information about both Universal and 20th Century Fox, try this advanced query: studio and ((Univeral OR Vivendi) AND ((20th OR Twentieth) NEAR Century)) studio and ((Univeral OR Vivendi) AND ((20th OR Twentieth) NEAR Century)) Wildcards: --> Use an asterisk (*) to broaden your search. To find any words that start with "screen," use screen* . This will match screens, screenplay, screenwriter and screenings, among others. Use this if the word you are searching for could have different endings. (for example, don't search for peripheral , search for peripheral* if it could be plural) Back to top   -->
