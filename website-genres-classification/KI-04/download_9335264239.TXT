How to get Bugzilla

Bugzilla and all of its source code are available for download. Bugzilla is licensed under the Mozilla Public License, and is thus both free and open source software.

Be sure to see the Installation section of the Bugzilla Guide (there's also a copy included in the tarball for versions later than 2.12).

If you want to know what's changed from one version to the next, view the changelogs for Bugzilla (generated directly from the raw CVS checkin messages).

Note for upgraders: If you have an existing installation based on a tarball from version 2.12 or later, you can update to the newest release using the CVS instructions below. This is a good way to update if you've made local changes, as CVS will attempt to merge your changes with the current release (although you may have to do some merging yourself if it finds conflicts between what you changed and what we changed - see the CVS documentation for details on conflict resolution).

A Word on Version Numbers

Bugzilla version numbers will be in the form of aa.bb or aa.bb.cc .

Stable release versions of Bugzilla will have an even number for bb. Any number in cc, if present, will indicate sequential updates to the stable version that will include security fixes that can't wait for the next stable release.

Development versions always have an odd number for bb. Development versions are released periodically, and cc only indicates the passage of time since the previous version (how much time is up for debate).

If you want a more stable release, you should use a tarball with an even number in the bb position in the version number. 

Development Release (2.17.6)

Bugzilla 2.17.6 is a Development Release and is intended for developers wishing to base large landings or patches off an official bugzilla.org release. It should not be used for production purposes, unless you have a Perl programmer on staff willing to put out any fires that may arise. The vast majority of sites wanting to test or use Bugzilla in production should install 2.16.4. If you're not sure whether you should use 2.17.6 or 2.16.4, you probably want 2.16.4.

A semi-in-depth look at the new features in 2.17.6 is available in our November 18th, 2002, January 2nd, 2003, April 24th, 2003, and November 2nd, 2003 Status Updates.

Download:

2.17.6 Tarball HTTP	 FTP	 (1197K)	 

If you are upgrading using CVS (instructions below), here are the tags:

* BUGZILLA-2_17_6- 2.17.6 specifically 

Windows users note: Bugzilla 2.17.6 does not work on Win32 without modifications. If you are using Windows, you'll need to pull a version from CVS and apply several patches. See the November 18th Status Update for details.

Localized Templates

As of Bugzilla 2.16, the capability exists to easily localize Bugzilla by creating templates in the language of your choice. Some languages are already available or in progress. The following is a list of the ones we know about at this time. These are third-party contributions, so if you need help with any of them, please contact the maintainer of the particular localization.

Old Stable Release (2.14.5)

NOTE: The 2.14.x series (originally released on August 29, 2001) has been discontinued and is no longer supported effective January 2, 2003. These files are included here only for the convenience of existing 2.14.x sites in need of security updates. All sites (including the existing 2.14.x sites) are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the 2.16.x series of Bugzilla, to not only take advantage of numerous bugfixes and new features, but also to continue to receive security updates.

Download:

2.14.5 Tarball HTTP	 FTP	 
2.14.4 to 2.14.5 patch HTTP	 FTP	 
2.14.3 to 2.14.4 patch HTTP	 FTP	 
2.14.2 to 2.14.3 patch HTTP	 FTP	 
2.14.1 to 2.14.3 patch HTTP	 FTP	 
2.14 to 2.14.3 patch HTTP	 FTP	 

If you are upgrading using CVS (instructions below), here are the tags:

* BUGZILLA-2_14-STABLE- latest 2.14.x stable release 
* BUGZILLA-2_14_5- 2.14.5 specifically 

Bugzilla CVS

If you'd like to have some additional flexibility, you can get Bugzilla from mozilla.org's anonymous CVS server. Of course, with this added flexibility comes a little bit more complexity. If you're not familiar with CVS, you can learn about it at the official CVS website.

Update Existing Install

If you have a tarball from version 2.12 or later, it is already primed for being updated via CVS. This allows updating to a newer version without downloading a new tarball. The first thing you need to do is login to the CVS server anonymously.

$ cd <bugzilla install directory> $ cvs login (Logging in to anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org) CVS password: anonymous 

If you have an existing install that you'd like to update, you can use the cvs updatecommand. However, you must use either the -Aor a -rflag.

If you wish to update to the most recent stable release, you should use the Bugzilla_Stabletag.

$ cvs update -rBugzilla_Stable -dP 

If you want to run the latest CVS tip (at your own risk), then use the -Aflag.

$ cvs update -A -dP 

You can also checkout older versions using CVS tags. All older tags follow the format of BUGZILLA-2_16_4. The syntax is the same as above for the Bugzilla_Stabletag.

REMEMBER: Any time you cvs updateyour Bugzilla install, always run checksetup.plto update any configuration changes the new version might need.

If you would like to submit patches, we'd prefer that you do so against the tip rather than a stable version. If you can't do your patch against the tip, then we'd rather have it against a release than not have it at all.

Initial Checkout

If you do not have Bugzilla yet (either from a post 2.12 tarball or a previous checkout from CVS) then you must use the cvs checkoutcommand. This is more difficult than downloading the tarball because Bugzilla's location in mozilla.org's CVS repository is three levels deep.

The first thing you have to do is log in to the CVS repository anonymously.

$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot $ cvs login (Logging in to anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org) CVS password: anonymous 

After that, you can either checkout the CVS tip or a specific release tag.

$ cvs checkout Bugzilla 

If you wish to get the most recent release out of CVS, you should use the Bugzilla_Stabletag.

$ cvs checkout -rBugzilla_Stable Bugzilla 

The Bugzilla files will now be in the mozilla/webtools/bugzillasubdirectory of the current working directory.

NOTE: The commands above use the syntax for bash like shells. Other shells, such as csh or windows, should be the same for everything but setting the environment variable. Sample syntax for these two shells are shown below.

csh: % setenv CVSROOT ":pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot" win: > SET CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot 

Any other shell's syntax is left as an exercise for the reader.
