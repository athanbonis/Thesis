CD-Recordable FAQ 

Last-modified: 2004/01/12
Version: 2.51

Send corrections and updates to Andy McFadden. If you have a question you'd like to see answered in here, either post it to one of the comp.publish.cdrom newsgroups (if you don't have the answer), or send it to fadden@fadden.com (if you do). 

This FAQ is usually updated about once a month. If you are looking at a version that is more than two or three months old, it may be an out-of-date copy. The most current version is always at http://www.cdrfaq.org/. 

This was originally developed (and is still maintained) as a Usenet newsgroup FAQ. If you'd like to check out the newsgroups, point your news reader at the following (or go to http://newsone.net/ and read them with your web browser): 

* comp.publish.cdrom.hardware 
* comp.publish.cdrom.software 
* comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia 
* alt.comp.periphs.cdr 

The "canonical" FAQ is available from http://www.cdrfaq.org/ in HTML format and from the MIT FAQ archives in plain text format. You can get an all-in-one-file version of the HTML in a .ZIP file, suitable for printing. Some translations are available: 

* Hungarian 
* Italian 
* French 
* Russian 
* Spanish 

If you're maintaining a translation, or just really want to know what has changed since the last update, you can get a set of context diffs in a .ZIP file. 

Please DO NOT post copies of the HTML version on your web site unless you plan to keep them up to date automatically. I have on several occasions received e-mail from people reading versions that are several months old. Just use a link to the www.cdrfaq.org site instead.
