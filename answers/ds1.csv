"he would have been grudgingly proud, but his own luck was fucked up and tainted everything and everyone around him.

No reason to not have a cigarette then.

Except. He'd just beat lung cancer. The hard way, because it didn't get much harder than ol' Nick ripping them out of your chest.

There was always the air outside for a little pollution, free of charge, so he opened his office window.

He wasn't sure what to do now. Part of him wanted a direction, part of him wanted to score some payback, but Gabriel was already paying one way or another and that left him where? Sitting in a dingy office, aimless, pondering whether to start drinking at 9 in the morning.

And then the Gates on his arms started to prickle with that feeling that there was an entity close by.That was what he got for opening a window. Windows were doors in more ways than the standard breaking and entering way. John left it open, let the humid night air waft in while he turned to put his back to the wall. Ready to use that window as a door, just in case he had to.

""Hey boss.""

The voice was startlingly familiar, as was the face and hesitant grin that appeared from the shadows.

He didn't move for a long moment, three, four heartbeats, while he wondered if it was a shape-shifter or a ghost come back to get him, or... Or if it had been malicious, he would've already been dead. Twice over.

""Chas?""

""Pretty much,"" Chas stepped forward and his reason  for lurking became clear. Wings. Big fucking angel wings, looking ruffled.

They were never white like in the pictures. Not really. The ones whose wings were white were pure, full host, not half, and the rest of them probably used spells, glamors or good old bleach. Chas's looked natural, white and grey mottled together, but John didn't reach out to touch them even if he wanted to. Didn't do much more than stare, at the wings, at Chas. ""Shouldn't you be in heaven?""

""Hey, you couldn't even get me to stay in the car, and you're a lot more scary than they are,"" Chas replied trying to sit on the edge of the desk. ""No one seemed to really cope with the fact that I don't have a compulsion to obey anyone.""

""They kicked you out?"" John moved in to steady his desk lamp as a wing edge smushed slowly into it, because that was the only thing he could think to say, like it was normal and casual and Chas was just asking to crash on his sofa for a night.

""More a case of I wandered out the door,"" Chas smirked. ""I'm too low on the ladder for anyone to give a toss y'know?. So..you need a driver?""

God.

John exhaled, tried to not let it sound as shakey as it felt coming out of his chest. ""Jesus, you're supposed to be fucking dead. That psychotic angel killed you.""

""Pretty much why I got my wings,"" Chas answered. ""And you know what? I kinda figured that if there was any poor bastard who needed a half assed guardian angel it would be you.""

Half-assed was right. He was standing too close to Chas, sliding the lamp into something like a safer position, trying to not feel the energy that was coming off of him. “I could use a full assed guardian angel, if you know someone who’s offering. I…”

Chas leaned forward and it was that same excitable grin. ""Unless you've found someone to replace me already?""

He couldn’t hold back the snort he gave. “Are you kidding? No one sane’d volunteer.”

""So you're up for an angel with a dubious sense of sanity?"" Chas replied. ""I thought you'd seen me rise anyway. Lifted from Perdition they call it.  Fancy way of saying things.""

“Well, you’d have to be insane to come back down here. With everything that happened, with everything…” That could happen again. Except that Chas had wings, wings and John didn’t know what else. Superhuman strength. Heat. Warmth when he leaned in and almost kissed him.

There is was, that look in his eyes. Totally inappropriate hero-worship. At least he had thought it was blind hero-worship but perhaps it had been something else all along. Something a little more base than Hero worship, something a little more frightening to feel coming off of an angel, even if Chas still looked like Chas, without the goofy hat. “I’m not barking up the wrong tree, am I?”

""No."" Chas' smile was dazzling and he looked like an angel should, lit up with something in his face rather than the ass-holish arrogance of the others. ""You have the Sight for the",candidate00001
"doors open.""

It sounded so much more bitter and acrimonious than any argument he and Molly ever had. There was the silent treatment, slammed doors, and then she'd sneak up behind him when he was smoking on the porch, and lay her head on his shoulder. Easy as that, enough to get either of them to apologize for whatever the hell it was. ""I know that saying 'I'm sorry' right now doesn't mean a thing. But I wish you hadn't had to go through that to end up here.""

Jim smiled a little. ""Yeah. Thanks. It's Ellie that I regret. I don't regret anything else, but I regret what it did to her.""

 

Of course he would. Jim didn't talk about Ellie much but he had a picture in his wallet. Most of the department didn't even know there was an Ellie. ""When she's an adult, hopefully she'll understand what happened.""

Jim shook his head. ""I doubt it. Janice will have put the blame on me, I know that much. She doesn't think I know but... well, I found out and that was the beginning of the end. I never had a daughter, Gil. Not really. And I was so wounded by that I let it drive me away from the nearest thing... right up to Vegas.""

""You never had a daughter?"" Gil frowned for a moment, and of course reality followed shortly after the thought. ""She wasn't yours.""

""That's right. My best friend Mike, on the force."" Jim shrugged again. ""Who incidentally I turned in along with a load of other Jersey cops for playing dirty. But by then, there was nothing left there for me, you know?""

""And when there's nothing left, there's nothing to do but move on."" Gil's mouth twitched a little as he looked down at the book he'd been reading. Jim called it shit, but it was something popular he'd picked up to keep himself busy while Gil had been spending most of his time sleeping. As far as crime novels went, Gil had read better in reports, but it was amusing to nitpick it in his head. ""I ended up out here because this is where Jack helped me set up.""

""Don't tell me that,"" Jim replied. ""I don't need a reason to be grateful to Jack. I'll tell you something, in Jersey? He would have had a mysterious accident pretty quickly.""

""It's a shame we weren't up a little further north instead of in Maryland."" Gil rubbed at his temple. ""I couldn't ever hurt Jack. I've just been tempted occasionally. It was my fault for agreeing to take the jobs.""

""Like you really had a choice,"" Jim said poking a knife into his vegetables to see how long they needed. ""Let me guess it was like a scene out of... one of those movies Archie always goes on about. Help us, Gil, you're our only hope! What are you meant to say to that? No? I'm taking time out from saving lives?""

""I was,"" Gil shrugged. ""I was working as a coroner. I managed to dodge him at work, but he caught up with me at home. It was... he showed me pictures of the two families. When they were alive."" Emotional manipulation, but Jack was good for a reason. That was what Jack did. ""The deal was that he was going to protect me. I should have known better by then. But you can still be young and stupid at thirty.""

""Yeah, look at Sanders,"" Jim grinned a little. ""I still reckon that Crawford is lazy. From what I hear, our guys are managing to piece things together.""

""How's that lazy?"" Gil glanced up at Jim, watching that grin. He was glad that even if he was there being a problem, Jim could at least still smile. ""He came in, stirred everyone up, and they're doing his work for him. That's creative.""

""He never has to do it himself. Because he has a 'King Cobra' to take the chances for him,"" Jim replied. ""You on the other hand, never ask something of one of your team that you wouldn't do or haven't done yourself.""

""Neither would you."" He'd always liked that about Jim. He didn't demand the impossible, just that things be done right the first time. Gil leaned his chin on one hand. ""Did he explain why they called Will that?""

""Not in so many words."" The way he looked at Gil asked for the explanation though. ""You want to tell me?""

 

Jim should have guessed that if Gil were unwilling to explain, he wouldn't have brought it up. It was more reminiscing than he'd done",candidate00001
".

Inexorably my mind turned to the times I had encountered him before. Each time he had conspired not only to commit treason, but somehow to save lives. The notions were contradictory, but somehow appropriate. And true, I knew they were true regardless of the politics of it.  ""How did you meet him?"" There was no question who 'him' was.
 ""After I was... discharged from the Army, and I discovered what had happened to my sister in my absence, I made some reckless and foolish decisions."" He gave me a thin smile. ""I believed that making enough of a disturbance would draw attention to the problem. Unfortunately it drew only attention to myself. Sherlock, despite his own state saved me from some of the darker agents of the Crown. From that moment, I had a purpose."" 
Treason. And attempting to save people from the fate of his sister, as if what had happened to her could not be undone. ""And an ally. It's a shame you can't redeem yourself somehow. You're talented enough.""

""I am redeeming myself,"" he answered. ""In my eyes at least.  We are a conquered people. No, to them we are not even people, we are...livestock. I can speak the heresy without flinching now because I have seen the truth of it that they conceal many times over and with my death, I have made arrangements for evidence to find it's way to every major newspaper in the civilised world. If Rache is not dead, then perhaps I can leave him a legacy of revolution to return to.""

""To what end? When a herd goes mad, a smart farmer slaughters them."" Sebastian took a swig of his beer, and leaned back again. ""What does one do when the very air fights you? When they walk among us?""

""To find out how to fight them, you would have to wait for that publication,"" he said and exhaled. ""I would not create that level of risk without the possibility of success.""

No, perhaps he would not and it made me intrigued somehow when I had considered myself beyond curiosity. ""How will you know if anyone will act on it?"" I leaned forward, elbows on the table, and tracked the motion of his eyes with my own, looking for un-surety, darting.

""I do not. Every man works to his own conscience,"" he answered. ""Perhaps it will all be for nothing but I will have tried."" His gaze was steady and honest and filled with something I could not name. Regret perhaps, or a wistfulness that this was the way things were.

""You're afraid it won't work."" He wasn't, but I felt like challenging him. ""You should be there to see this through, but you don't want to see the consequences if it fails.""

""I'm not sure I want to see the consequences if it succeeds,"" he answered. ""And yourself, what is your history with Moriarty?""

""Medical discharge after Afghanistan. I shouldn't have survived at all. He needed… a foil more than someone to help with the price of the flat. We were a well matched fit, and after Victoria Gloriana healed my arm, it eased many of my concerns."" I had many doubts and fears and concerns, but I kept them close to my chest and had since my early days in the service.

""There are some of the Old Bloods who could do that,"" the doctor agreed. ""I was concerned he might try something similar again as to using you for expediency.""

""I suppose the opportunity never came up again."" I noted it wryly. ""We never spoke of it again, and he was forgiven for his failure. If I had known…"" I still cannot say if I would have gone along with it, but I felt the outrage and betrayal fresh in my heart reflecting on the memory.

""You should not have been in that position. Or what happened the last time we were here. He used you then to lure the Hound.""

I scoffed quietly, looking down at our empty plates, and hailed the barman for another round. ""I knew what I was doing with the Hound. I'd hunted foul creatures before my discharge, and I knew what baited them best.""

""It nearly had you,"" he reminded me. ""You were lucky.""  ""Luck had nothing to do with it. And your Rache, I'm sure he put you at risk for the cause."" It was hard to imagine that Rache had not been as obsessed as James had been in those last few weeks.

""Mmm."" His non-committal utterance was as much as a confirmation as I needed. It seemed both of us had issues with our companions. It was only after the drink had been brought and the other man had doggedly drunk down half of it that he said quietly. ""Did you love him?""

A more damning question had seldom been asked; still, for those who know me, and had known James, it",candidate00001
"hey, perhaps he'd like to test that authority out on him...

Well, that was an interesting thought right there.

Alistair lay back on his bedroll and drowsily fantasized. They were the last two, who better to turn to? He would broach the subject one night by the fire. Maybe he'd take him a rose. No, no he'd laugh. He didn't want people to laugh like that at him.

He didn't really expect to wake up to a dark shadow in the tent, darker than the dull dark of the campfire, a moving shadow, and he would've yelled -- loudly, in a manly fashion of course -- if there hadn't been a hand over his mouth.

There might have bit of a manly flail, because even when he realized who it was from the gleam of long blond hair and the exotic facial tattoos, this was not a particularly comforting thought. The Antivan was an assassin and this easy come easy go attitude to loyalty, it wasn't something he could get his head around. There was only one reason Zevran could have to be in his tent and that was to kill him!

""Shhh, shh, no need to cause a ruckus…"" Zevran was lying down on top of him, and oh god he was going to smother him.

""Mmph!"" Alistair managed which was actually in his head 'Zevran what by all the hells are you doing? Oh Maker, don't cut off anything I might need!'

""Shhhh. I only want to… test my skills."" He finally moved his hand off of Alistair's mouth.

""Pardon me if I don't find that particularly reassuring,"" Alistair hissed back in a bare whisper, ""Because last I heard your skills were as an  assassin.""

""Yes, and I pick locks as well. I have been thinking of your particular lock here. And can you blame me?"" It didn't surprise Alistair when Zevran put a hand over his groin.

""Oh, hey, whoa, well that's interesting."" He could throw Zevran, he out-massed him, but right now he was paralyzed by the touch over that area. ""Uh, you know, it's a magic lock and I know you keep telling everyone you've got magic fingers and, you know, offering back rubs and any type of rub you think you can get, but... Templar lock.""

""All the more reason I want to try to get through it,"" Zevran drawled. ""How long has it been, uhm?""

""How do you even know about it?"" Alistair asked belatedly. Zevran was fiddling with it. That caused all sorts of interesting sensations as the cage around his cock suddenly felt very constrictive and... nice.

""I've watched you. Luridly I might add. It's very easy, to watch you."" The edge of his mouth was curling up wickedly.

""Well watching is one thing and... Uh, what you're doing there is something else!"" Alistair's voice rose a little. ""You know, I do have my virtue and, well uh..."" It did seem a little ridiculous now he came to say it aloud.

""Your virtue. Yes, I have considered that. It would be an honor to take it from you."" Like his virginity was so much as picking a pocket!

""Yes, but..."" Alistair began. ""Do I get a choice in this? Or is this how you get your reputation? I thought you were too busy watching Wynne's bosom. You talk about it often enough. She must be three times your age and you're still flirting.""

""She's a very buxom woman,"" Zevran shrugged. ""Wise as well, and wise old buxom women still enjoy hearing that they have nice bosoms. Particularly when it's true."" In with the chatter, he was definitely stroking his hand around the magicked metal.

""Uh, look, not that what you're doing doesn't stir up some interest down there, but it's not comfortable interest and you can't break the lock. I'd rather not have a night of compressed balls, so..."" Alistair paused as he looked at what Zevran's fingers were actually doing. ""Wow, that's uh... well, how do your fingers move like that?

""Years of work. Excuse me, I have to see what I'm doing as well as feel it."" Then Zevran was sliding down his body and oh, his mouth was far too close to Alistair's trapped and now trying to get free cock.

This was pretty much what they had been completely forbidden to do. Messed with the training, the Templars said. Couldn't knock out a Mage's magic without it. No one had explained why and let's face it, he was a warrior now. Losing that ability didn't seem a bad trade from the way that Zevran was fondling his cock, pressing deep against the tight fitting cage. He wasn",candidate00001
"a madhouse, or still in the pits in Afghanistan. I leave that decision to you dear reader, as if you read this account, then surely I am real as the words on the page. The figure in the chair moved, a bare inclination of his head.

""Sebastian, I see I calculated your return correctly,"" he said and with those simple words my doubt was removed, but also the breath from my lungs as surely as if I had been struck. His eyes were bright, and glittering in the firelight and his mouth quirked in the manner that I instinctively knew meant to be his version of great humor, or perpetrating a wonderful jest.

My filthy pack was set on the ground and I have no recall of putting it there myself, nor of making any other sensible movement, though clearly I did these things unbidden by my conscious thoughts. ""How?"" It encompassed so many questions which danced in my mind.

""Calculating your return? A mere calculation of factors, and habits,"" James replied. “But of course you mean my presence. A mystery for the ages indeed. Some things are best left that way."" he said with infuriating evasiveness.

It was ever his way, and I wondered if it was due to the Queen's trust of him. Not out of reverence but out of wanting to keep a plaything alive.

 ""Are you...?"" Still human I wanted to ask though I don't know if he ever was on the same level as myself and other ordinary folk.

""Intact? Yes."" It was not an answer to the question I wanted to ask but it sufficed. 

It encapsulated the major concerns, though I was not sure intact mattered much when it came to them. I edged nearer, willing my knees to bend and feet to lift, finally close enough to touch his shoulder, seeking body heat as proof.

He was solid, real and he turned his head to meet my gaze and for the briefest moment I was convinced I saw an iridescence much like light on the carapace of a beetle shimmer over the black center of his eye.  James was returned but not unchanged unless it was my own mind giving me visions.

""I am real Sebastian, and I might be somewhat changed, but I am still your companion James Moriarty.""

""I know what they did to me. I've seen what happened to other soldiers."" Gibbering didn't always mean a ruined mind from my experience but sometimes something possessed by horror. Sometimes I'd suspected that something of the others, of royalty, had come back in the person and been incapable of using the body appropriately.

He looked at me for a long moment. ""Their realm breaks the ordinary mind Sebastian. Perhaps it is to that you owe your survival as you are far beyond the normal soldier. I attribute my own survival to my extraordinary mind. There is so much I know now Sebastian, so much!"" His face was paled and his eyes burned fanatically in darkened sockets, but I had seen him that way many times when upon a case and to my shame, the shock of his presence blinded me to some of the signs.

Here was a dead man sitting in front of me, animated and speaking, his physical mannerisms as they had ever seemed to be. ""Do you know what is going on here?”

""Yes. And it is far bigger than you can comprehend Sebastian,"" he replied. ""Sit, you are quite pale with shock.""

It was odd for him to attempt to comfort me, after all over a year missing. ""I've been out there killing these things as they encroach on us,"" I countered, because just then I needed no tender ministrations. I needed physical proof, I needed to be surer of what was before my eyes, and what my ears were hearing.

""Then tell me what you have surmised so far,"" he said gesturing again to the chair opposite him.

Reluctantly I took my place across from him, watching his eyes all the while. ""Royals not our own are encroaching on our lands. Known ones, named ones that have been foretold of in ancient histories. The King in Yellow is dead, as are more, acts sanctioned by Victoria herself.""

It was a simple way to describe the events, but accurate in my opinion.

""Indeed. And like the proverbial tip of the tentacle, that is all we see,"" James said. He leaned forward. ""Now imagine if you can how the Royals and the Sleeping Ones truly go to war. This is but the opening arguments, your previous wars a spillover of discontent from That Place to here.""

Truly, the suggestion changed nothing of my outlook -- as a soldier and a patriot. ""And?""

""Before we have been toys and playthings. Insignificant or cherished pets at best. Now we have proven a threat. Victoria Gloriana rises meteoric and old alliances shift and collapse, feeding grounds move and with it treaties crumble,"" James recited it with an edge in his voice, hysteria or mania I did not know, all the more chilling for his calm. ""War comes to Albion on",candidate00001
"form of charm.

Someone from before, old memories, times he had yielded back to their keepers, their holders, until he had been free again. It threatened to weigh on him, but he leaned in, keeping a hand on the edge and a close balance of himself as he put his face through the gate.

""Now that..."" a voice said that he recognized all too well. ""...took even less time than I thought. You must be bored Lucifer.""

A figure, a being coalesced together, coming to a point of existence not far in front of him.

""That depends on your perception of time."" Not standing outside of creation, but within it. His coup, in so many ways, the creator at once beyond and simultaneously less than his Father. ""You called me.""

""Yeah."" Elaine stood there, wearing the same form as he remembered before she had become God. ""I thought I would see how you are doing out here swimming around in the primordial soup.""

He slipped through a little further, perched between the void and her side of the gate, her creation. ""Swimmingly. And you, creator?"" Part of him hoped that she held true to what she has learned, still, though he did not know how much 'time' had passed.

There was just a moment of expression in her eyes that he recognized from the days when things had been so simple and she had just been a girl accidentally getting involved with him for simple reasons. ""That's a bit formal. I still think of myself as Elaine.""

He contemplated his words, because the heaviness of lack of time was on his side, watching her expression. She, too, had experienced the slowing of it, and the pulls and sharp tugs at the same time. He wondered what it felt like for the endless to traipse through her being, her creation. That was a question he'd never had answered. ""Good. It suits you.""

""I have to have something that is just me,"" Elaine said with a faint smile.  She remained loitering on the threshold with him. ""Look at you. How have you been?""

Like a doting family member. ""Traveling. Seeing what there is to see.""

""And what is there to see in the Void?"" she asked. He could feel the sharp vibrancy of existence wrapped around her.

Like a living thing, completely interwoven with her. She embraced that power, in a way Michael had long abandoned. He let the sensation wash over him, let it tingle his senses in a way emptiness hadn't. ""Nothing.""

""Mmm. Have you had your fill of emptiness?"" she said with a hint of wry irony.

 He made a noncommittal noise as he leaned slightly further into her creation. ""The grass is greener."" He had forgotten the intensity of things rather than the half formed potentialities. There were things out there that moved in the darkness. Strange things, the nightmares of insane gods, the ruins of universes abandoned to the gnawing parasites of entropic heat death.

He had looked and stopped and observed and let it pass, let it all pass, or they had let him pass, and that was the question. What next and what now, and the dizzying sensation of a familiar creation curling at the edges of his senses. ""I would be an aberration to your creation.""

She looked at him with those eyes there were at once the creators' and that of the twelve year old girl who had accidentally summoned the Devil. ""No, you wouldn't,"" she said simply. ""How could you be?""

There was no role for him to fill, for he had passed those burdens on to better actors. It was a freedom, in its own way, to be beyond those stages and requirements. ""That is perhaps a question you don't want to ask.""

""I do and I have,"" Elaine asked and smiled.""You are always welcome in this creation. You are no aberration Lucifer.""

He had watched it unfold from a position, if not the exact time, and felt the tug of experience, memories and past which he had not been willing to yield to his father. The scar was his, his past, his decisions, still his. ""I will leave again, after a while."" He kept a hand on the edge of the door, but curiosity beckoned him further.

""You think someone always has an ulterior motive don't you?"" Elaine said by way of an answer. ""Plans within plans, within ever convoluted plans.""

What he had learned  from Yahweh, his Father. From his brother.

He felt the smile touch his face as he looked out across her creation, and then to her again. ""Perhaps, perhaps not. Perhaps I know I will be restless again.""

""That's okay,"" she said. ""I just wanted you to know you have a Home."" Such a simple innocent powerful statement. Even his own Creation had not truly felt like home. He had never been entirely sure why.

Perhaps because of schemes and plans",candidate00001
"ll turn up here again, okay?""

""Got it, Dad. I promise to stay in touch."" Greg hesitated as they reached the doorway even as his mother moved forward to hug him and kiss him. The flinch was hidden this time and he managed to accept her contact and concern.

""Take care of yourself, Greg, sweetie,"" she said as she straightened up. ""And of Gil, too.""

Greg nodded. ""That we definitely agree on.""

""It was good to meet you both, though I wish it hadn't been under these circumstances."" Gil stood up, shadowing Greg to the door before he offered both of them a hand shake.

Pete shook his hand with a firm grip, and Rane treated him to a hug as well much to everyone's astonishment. 

""You make sure you take care of yourself as well, Gil,"" she said even as she stepped back. ""You've got our numbers, Greg's got our e-mail. You let us know anything.""

""We will."" Gil wasn't quite sure what 'anything' entailed, but it sounded like she wanted to hear any news, good or bad. Gil stepped back to stand beside Greg in the doorway. ""Have a safe trip back home.""

The watched as Greg's parents left, Greg finally pushing the door shut as their car pulled away.

""I shouldn't be glad they're gone but... Jesus, I don't think I could deal with them being around. Congratulations, Gil, you've survived a visit from my mother.""

There was something about the tone of Greg's voice, something about the texture of his words, and while Gil couldn't pick up what it was, he could tell it was there. He shifted closer, slid an arm over Greg's shoulder and then slowly, a little awkwardly embraced him. ""So did you.""

Greg turned into him and leaned, ""She doesn't mean it. She never means it. She just has this uncanny way of saying exactly the wrong thing..."" he mumbled into him. ""Usually it doesn't matter, I don't care but... oh god, Gil, do you think the same? That it's like me raping you, having my child forced on you?""

The leaning felt good, and he could feel Greg's words more than he heard them. He moved fingers, a little awkward still, and rubbed down Greg's back. ""No. I'm... grateful that it is yours, actually. That it wasn't one of them. If they hadn't kept saying that it was yours, I...""

Greg was holding him as well and he could feel as well as hear the sigh of relief at that. ""We were a good match, they said. I... god, it wears me out dealing with Mom. I love her and Dad, but even at the best of times, I spend forever afterwards as some sort of wreck. You were great. And I'm really glad you weren't horrified at the thought it was mine.""

The thought that it was there at all was so much more pressing than worrying over whose it was, but Gil didn't say that. He just nodded, and finally started to back up towards the sofa. ""You're smart, bright, and ambitious, you like to learn, and you worry about people. You'll make a good father."" A better father than Gil himself, but there wasn't any sense in saying that, either

""So will you,"" Greg said as he eventually sat on the couch. He looked directly at Grissom. ""You're not going to leave this all to me, you know."" He smiled a little at him but his expression was worried and more than a little serious.

""I hope not,"" Gil shrugged casually, one arm still around Greg as they settled down, side-by-side, leg against leg. ""I just... the way you've reacted helps me. I'm glad you came here.""

""Even with the woods rescue and the parents from hell?"" Greg grinned a little. ""Well, with any luck, we got my obstacles out of the way, so we get to concentrate on you now.""

If Greg thought they were going to deal with just one person at a time, he was insane. Gil leaned in a little more, peering at Greg's shifting eye movements. ""We can both concentrate on getting better and coping.""

""You get closer, Griss, and I might just have to kiss you again,"" Greg said almost nervously. ""It's like a reaction I have.""

""Closeness bringing about some strange kissing reaction?"" Gil didn't move, shift forward or backwards. ""We could test it scientifically, but I'm not sure what the control would be.""

Greg shifted just a little closer to him. ""Tell me no and I'll back off,"" he said",candidate00001
"approached me now.

""I  would not take arms against you, son of Arathorn,"" I told him quietly  when he had at last stopped several feet beyond my spot. ""My enemy is  but the Eye, within its cold Tower, and those who serve beneath him be  it willingly or otherwise at this point. If you think it wise to draw  Andúril against me I will not oppose it, and indeed I would welcome the  touch of that legendary blade if it were otherwise so presented."" I said  quietly and firmly.

Our eyes looked upon one another and the  connection of a Soul Gaze established itself- only to be reflected, cast  aside and denied by some inner will and wellspring of strength he  possessed- no doubt the fortitude that had allowed him to throw aside  Sauron's black will when he looked upon the Palantir properly some weeks  from now.

He drew the hilt out a few inches without flinching,  though I couldn't exactly say the same, as I blinked and leaned back in  surprise; it felt like the utter denial that the Guardian Angel serving  beneath Uriel had performed, when I chose to see it with my Wizards  Sight.

""You may have tried to conquer my spirit, Istari,""  he stated softly as the blade rose further still, ""but I have taken it  unto myself and reversed your spell; and lo! I have seen some glimpse of  what you are, and of what you represent. You are not of Arda, not  wholly, and nor would I claim you to be that which you state; but I have  seen the Vala you proclaim and in him is the fire of Ilúvatar. To what  reasons you have come are not clear to me- but I am assuaged of your  intentions to aide the Fellowship,"" he said slowly.

I exhaled in  relief and smiled loosely before he drew the sword in full, and Andúril  sliced a thin line across my left cheek while my guard was down. I  hissed lowly as the absurdly sharp edge bit through my gathered flesh  and spilled faint dews of blood across the grass.

He stared a  moment more before sheathing his sword and leaning down, gripping my  right hand and drawing me back to my feet. ""Rise, Dresden the Black,"" he  intoned. I gripped my staff and drew it upright as well, recognizing  the reason for his action even if it burned irritably, and I shuffled my  staff to the crook of one elbow so that I could press the same hand  against my cheek.

""Look and see, my companions! This battle has  been fought and the stranger bleeds as truly as you and I, were we dealt  such a cut. What suspicions as I held are allayed at this moment, and I  ask that you as well set them aside ere we go forward."" Aragorn called  back to the other two.

End of Chapter Two.

Things become tenser still between Dresden the Black and the Fellowship.

Boromir stood firm as Aragorn and I approached, suspicion not only present in the hard lines of his face, but outright scorn. ""Hail I say to you, son of Denethor and Glóin, thrice and for all this morrow,"" I said at once, lingering not long upon the man's distrust for instead I felt it right to kneel and present myself for the dwarf's approval.

Boromir could be checked by the Dunedain at my side, and they had passed through Gimli's long forsaken homeland only to find it in ruination and flame, host to an evil that few are aware of in modern times. An injustice if ever there were one, and Gandalf had given his life to see the Fellowship to safety. For that alone I could not hold myself back.

""To what fate has done to you and yours in Moria long behind, I offer condolences and more, for I have it not only in my power to fix, mayhap, but only the pressing matter of time that denies my offer to you now."" Gimli's stony features could have chiseled yet further, almost to match the man beside him, and I spoke thus, ""Yet when we've the freedom, when this journey has seen itself through to the very end, I offer you my aide as Istari in this further venture, son of Glóin: Moria shall be renewed. If it does not gleam as the white walls of the White City, I offer you my staff and knowledge to make it so ere I wander back from Arda, be thus in yonder months or many years. Your home shall be renewed!""

I could but feel the sneer which graced good Boromir's expression next. Indeed, his words were not to be unexpected, given such a vast and terrible claim. I might of as well have sworn to march forward into Mordor and tear down the black tower of Barad-dur with my own hands.

""For pity's sake,"" he exclaimed, ""do you not see the silver tongue that flashes in the light? Do you not hear the honeyed lies clear as this winding horn I carry?""

Gimli met my gaze without flinching. He buried his axe in the ground between us with a mighty huff. ""How my heart longs for",candidate00002
"meter in just seconds. In under a minute he stepped back from an arching tent as tall as he and just as wide as their camels meandering nearby.

""Ladies first.""

He gestured her in with a hand on the opening, pulling back the thick fold. Miss Carnahan peered in warily. The next moment she made a little noise of delight mixed with wonder in the back of her throat that did very interesting things for his libido, though he squashed the initial stirring before it bloomed into something harder to wrangle under control.

""As I said, ma'am, more than enough rooms, and all the comforts I pegged you for needing, full bedroom and bath, stocked kitchen, even a small library next to the common room to help with your inquiries. Unfortunately no wireless seems to pick up a signal where we'll be going in the weeks ahead, if my experiences in deserts and old magic are anything to go by.""

He let her enter and stepped back, fiddling with his satchel of ropes dumped carelessly to the sand. While far more simple he had no need to enjoy the luxury or accommodations of a team-class dwelling. She poked her head back out to stare at him with a good deal less animosity. ""Aren't you coming in?"" she asked.

""No ma'am. Wouldn't want the crew to get suspicious,"" he said good-naturedly. Then he tugged a rope end and his workman's tent began compiling like a set of dominoes falling into place, popping into position at knee-height. Unlike her own, his truly was a simple thing, only a little wider within than the size without. He shrugged his way in and sighed when his head met the make-due pillow of a rolled up rug.

He heard her footsteps coming around the end and then she was kneeling by his boots and looking at him incredulously. ""Surely you cannot be comfortable in that, Mr. Weasley.""

He yawned behind one hand. ""If I worried about comfort, Miss Carnahan, I wouldn't be a curse breaker. Don't forget to zip the opening before you turn in. Good morning."" He tucked his feet in and toed the opening closed before her nose, letting his mind drift to a place of quiet contemplation.

""Ooh!"" Her protest brought a rough grin to his lips.

Their journey ticked by on the calendars kept by Bill and the leading goblin, Cthukuk, who finally deigned to speak with him on the eighth night. Unfortunately for them both, that happened to be the point by which he'd put together a reasonable understanding of where and when his life, and by association Miss Carnahan's, would be forfeit; when they finally closed toward her fabled Hamunaptra. And the stars in conjunction with the analysis of her map were leading them fairly true.

""We are nearing, wizard.""

Cthukuk's voice in English felt as comforting as a Banshee's opening wail. Given his run in with two over the course of his life to date, and Fleur in full-on Veela wrath did not count, Bill resisted the urge to wince with a surprising degree of success.

""I was beginning to think the same,"" he answered obliquely.

Cthukuk gave him no other warning. No sinister, premeditated chuckle. No whistle to coordinate with the others nearby. Not even the swish of a hitherto-concealed dagger rising from the folds of a thrown-back cloak. The goblin simply pointed and the rune-encrusted rings around his swollen index finger spat a wave of invisible force against the body of Hannibal, his camel.

Bill had known to expect something, but kinetic energy was not one of the areas he had prepared for. Hannibal went down in an explosion of blood and fur, sending Bill himself into a headlong tumble that he barely turned into a halted roll back toward his beloved mount for a fraction of protection.

Nearby Miss Carnahan screamed. The other goblins split their numbers, two more encircling his position to flank him, the remainder going after her. In an instant a sense of protective duty reared up inside of his admittedly shaken head.


Bugger this!


A thin brass flute materialized in Bill's right hand, loosened from the holster around his upper arm. There was barely enough time to raise it to his lips, and even before he made contact with the tip he was breathing out in a seemingly nonsensical rush. The first silver rings surrounding him hummed as a volley of force raced forward, throwing bits of camel and desert sands skyward. Then a piercing wail rose up on the wind from every corner at once, a tone of deafening, all-pervading volume that burrowed into the ears and set up an amphitheater with no way out. The goblins by instinctive nature snarled in Gobbledygook and clapped their burnished fingers against their ears, while beneath them the orcneas bellowed as if being slaughtered, thrashing their leathery heads from side to side; thick spurts of metallic green blood splashed across the desert floor. Gone insensate with pain the mad mounts charged head-long into each other, crazed with agony.

"they were behaving like good little servants to Mab's ironclad-will compared to that?
Hindsight response; it matters a whole damn lot, that's what.
She made her move while I was still at the 'dribble soup across my chest unless told to close my mouth and swallow' stage. Normally arctic shades of blue, green, and piercing violet were whitewashed to a nondescript flat tone throughout her hair, itself unbraided and laying lifeless around her brow and neck in a way that, even had I retained my full senses, I would have been hard-pressed to guess was the Winter Lady, the Queen-in-the-making, Maeve.
I still remember the first thing that caught my attention beyond the usual and tried to warn me away from what was to come - her eyes. Carefully concealed behind that don't-look-at-me hairdo until the door closed with all the finality of the headsman's axe. Then she tilted her head back to peer at me, with eyes that glittered of delicious satisfaction, the huntress cornering the wounded prey - in fact, no, even that does not convey the measure of her gaze upon my form in proper truth. I'm being far too generous to my own unstable position back then.
Her look said, in no uncertain terms, that I was a drowning man half-way down the whirlpool, clinging desperately to a strip of wood as the sky roared with thunder and sleet and the waves crashed down relentlessly from above. And she was just the latest force of unforgiving nature falling from on high to snuff my pitiful existence from the world. It said I was a dead man no matter what happened next, coasting along on borrowed time before the inevitable end, and that I could choose to let go and be dragged down by the current or smashed to tinder like the driftwood holding me afloat.
And would you like to know what I did in response to that deadly gaze? I'd love to say I sat up straight, gave her the finger, and vanished back to Chicago with a well-placed aparturum and witty remark to remember me by. I'm sure some part of my brain was desperately firing on all cylinders with the explicit orders to do just that, which turned to frothing at the metaphorical mouth as I just lay there paralyzed with cold terror instead.
My tongue went drier than it already had been. A vicious sweat broke out across my forehead and palms, hair standing on edge from the neck down, and my breath came in slow and painfully clenched exertions.
""Oh, my Knight,"" she cooed in a mocking tribute to Mab, ""my poor, poor Knight, whatever shall you do?"" She strode forward and laid the platter with my chicken broth to one side of the bed, stretched out a section of sheet beside my left hip, and sat down rather more primly than her attitude and look promised she could do. I flinched just from proximity to her and those unrelenting eyes.
""Why ever do you tremble so?"" she asked in a sort of sing-song tone perfectly at odds with her expression.
When I did not answer Maeve reached out to the bowl and swept a spoonful up to her own lips, which parted just enough to take the fluid in, and then without swallowing or spilling a drop she leaned forward to press them against my own. A shudder of pure chill raced down my body from the point of contact straight to my toes, plush though those lips were against my own courser finish. Her tongue darted out to part mine and in a disgusting take on the French kiss, or maybe the snowball depending on your savviness, she tilted her head down enough to pass the now-cold broth between us in one slow motion. Her tongue roved out and wrestled mine down with no effort until the last transfer of fluids was completed.
I felt the quirk in her mouth as she smiled and pulled back, one hand rising to swipe away the trail of saliva cooling into frost between our mouths, the other coming up beneath my chin to close my mouth before I dribbled across the sheets.
""Swallow."" She ordered without a trace of her former pleasant tones.
I swallowed, and even had the good sense to open again without being told. I couldn't tell why she was doing this, but looking back I recognize how much satisfaction she was reaping from the oral rape.
She repeated the process once, twice, thirty times. However many it took to empty the bowl, and all the while the only thing I felt was terrified urges to obey and please the inhuman thing before me. The clamor that had erupted across my flesh at her presence had since gone on to leave me shivering from the lump of half-frozen soup sluicing back and forth in my gut.
""Mm, so cold. We mustn't let the Winter Knight freeze to death."" She pressed me down into the bedding and for a long moment I feared she would climb atop and smother me. Instead she drew the blankets up to my chin and used that as an excuse to lean in and press her",candidate00002
".

The Third righted that matter with the end of a rigid pole. Just as two months earlier, lighting his pipe so quickly that Naruto could not even read the hand seals, so too did the Hokage move like the wind in striking down each remaining Iwa-nin that closed in on them, smashing the bodies to the ground only to fling them skyward the next instant in a blur of precision. In a handful of beats sixteen men came crashing to the hard land, unconscious.

The last, the commander of the strike team, watched from a measured distance. ""Iwa remembers,"" he bit out hotly, and before the stretching staff could reach him, the man leveled the earth upwards beneath their feet and the wagon where the Third and the merchant stood, and then he was gone underground.

In the aftermath of the surprise assault, the Third sent his walking, talking staff to finish bringing the scroll merchant on into Iwa proper, and issued a return to Konoha for the rest of them while the evening hours still burned red on the horizon. Naruto complained loudly about being sent home without seeing the mission through to its completion, but he quelled soon enough before the Third's stare.

""'least we got to use our kenjutsu sommat,"" he muttered under his breath to his teammates. Kiba was less enthused, but it was Ino who seemed to be downright shaken by her contributions in the act of death. Naruto could, for once, sympathize. Mizuki's demise had not been a pleasant introduction to the real side of the ninja arts awaiting them down the road.

They reached the gates of Konoha by sunrise of the second morning following the incident. Unknown to his students, the Third Hokage had sat watch while they slept fitfully each time they bedded down for the night, thoughts too full to sleep even had he not been intent on seeing Team Sarutobi returned to Konoha safely.

Naruto frowned. ""So what do we do in the meanwhile?""

""What else? Train. There's no guarantee anyone will be nominated.""

And on that ominous note, one week later, the same Jōnin came around to break the news; ""Sorry to say it, but Lord Hokage can not in good faith nominate Team Sarutobi for this year's Chuunin Exams. Better luck next time.""

A cold stone sank down Naruto's gullet and settled into place amidst his ramen noodles. Kiba and Akamaru pitched a fit, complaining about the man hours spent working together for nothing this year, while Ino rolled her eyes and left without a word.

""But… but we worked so hard!"" Naruto finally said to the silver haired man. ""We even fought off those Iwa shinobi! The Old Man's been drilling us fiercely for over two months! What more does he want?""

The Jōnin stared at him with a curious expression. ""Sometimes your skill and dedication just aren't enough to cut it, kid. Lord Hokage's decision is final. There's always next year.""

Below, Sasuke, of course, because who else but the prestigious bastard of the Uchiha clan, was fighting another genin from Suna and holding his own against the barrage of sand attacks.

Naruto squinted at his Academy rival and secretly hoped to see him beaten to a bloody pulp, but what were the odds of that actually happening? So far, slim to none. Red eyes aglow, Sasuke was countering every attack thrown his way, and landing a handful of his own in retribution.

After twenty minutes Naruto gave up and stood up, working back from the crowd into the rest of the Academy and then into the village center. I could really go for about ten bowls of Teuchi's tastiest, spiciest ramen right now, he lamented. I'll even settle for the fish roe ramen.

He never got the chance.

The village lit up like a bonfire, as throughout, ten infiltrators set into motion Konoha's destruction and the taking of the hidden beasts pooled together.

""Naruto!"" Ino was the first to reach him after the explosions stopped, finding the other blond half buried in a pile of debris. Naruto grunted as he crawled out from beneath a shattered wall, bleeding from half a dozen small but irritable wounds. He wiped a torn sleeve across his brow and held his arm there to stem the flow from reaching his eyes.

""Oh kami, Naruto, it's awful! We need to find Kiba!""

""What the hell happened?""

""I don't know!""

A man stepped out from the shadows behind them, an older, harrowed, sterner copy of Sasuke. Naruto stared at him blankly, briefly wondering how the bastard had grown over a foot and when did his Sharingan start bleeding from the tear ducts, when the longest three days of the young ninja's life came crashing down upon him in a reign of horrible fire and memories of torture, the Iwa battle gone catastrophically wrong.

Ino screamed when her teammate collapsed bonelessly, shivering, to the ground. When the darker Sasuke turned his bleeding gaze upon her she hit him with all the oomph of her Shintenshin no Jutsu",candidate00002
"a double handful of ash and nearly dead embers from the silent fireplace burned to its last, and set it down atop the girl's bedding. The sparks leapt and fell with only a bit of encouragement from his breath. In no time at all a crackling flame danced wickedly about the surface and spread toward whatsoever it could find.

Satisfied that the room would soon be in cinders, he checked to be sure the boy was still alive. Tiny lungs drew in breath and expelled it, even as the eyes were shut tight. He ripped a long strip from the girl's skirt and wrapped the last Potter heir in it rather than keep the old banner, then placed the tiny boy into a fold sewn into his cloak near the back. It was already filled with small ointments to slow blood loss and sooth pain, but as he had no need of such yet, he dumped them out upon the table to make room. The boy fit just-so inside.

""This will be a hard life, child. I hope for both our sakes that I can lie as well as I think I can."" The smoke filling the space began to make it hard to breath as it doubled back upon itself, and so he wrenched open the door again, paused to throw his now-useless ointments upon the blaze, and stepped out into a new future, for House Black as well as House Potter.

The son of a Ser.


Harry


""Come, lad, at it again!"" Harry Rivers scrambled off his wet arse before his Lord Father had even finished the taunt, hastening across the slippery slope to reclaim his hunting dagger from the shallowest stretch of riverbed. It was a small thing by the measure of full-grown men, but for a youth of just eight, it fit his palms and then some so that he had to grip it as if it were a bastard sword. Which was fitting, for he himself was a bastard.

But no such blade could claim to be even half as fine as his dagger, with its rich wine red-entwining-green leather wrapped hilt and polished, now gleaming silvered-red blade free of blemishes, untarnished despite the months of training, and a firm edge along each side perfect for peeling back fur and hide that narrowed to a wicked point well suited to stabbing. The Old Magic had tempered it long ago, according to his Lord Father, which was the only reason why he allowed the grip to hold onto the traitorous colors of House Potter alongside the velvet black-green of House Gaunt. That lustrous leather lay damp and cool from the latest bath in the stream. Harry squeezed tight, and fat droplets of water oozed out from between his fingertips to splash around his sopping wet boots.

Satisfied it wouldn't turn in his hands, Harry launched himself around the river stones of his name with a cry of determination.

Ser Sirius Black, aged eight-and-twenty, eyed the boy charging him with splashing footfalls and nimbly stepped back without a glance to the treacherous rocks passing beneath his own boot soles, smoothing down the front of his ragged shirt and yawning widely in dismissal. The long black and blunted training blade clutched in his off-hand dipped and rose with the motion.

Harry's own muddled green eyes dilated, widening at first by the casual disregard, narrowing the next beat with renewed vigor. Even so as he hopped quickly amidst the deepening pool and pull of the stream he had to turn his gaze upon each step in his way to be sure he didn't slip or turn an ankle in the numerous faults lurking beneath the surface. It had taken him two weeks to recover from the swelling the last time, to no end of mockery in the interim by his Uncle Regulus.

""I haven't all day, you know.""

Harry finally reached his Lord Father and swung widely upward, aiming for the shins or, better yet, the thighs. He couldn't yet reach the belly and he knew better than to aim for the manhood. It wasn't his place to",candidate00002
"you.

Slowly coming up to my feet, I leveled him a wary look and opened my mouth to respond. ""I'm listening. What do you want?""

I'd have phrased it nicer, but who am I kidding; I could sooner keep the insolence from my tone as the moon could refuse to rise every evening.

Khronos spared me a bland look and motioned one hand around himself slowly, and then arched an eyebrow, as if saying Out here? Are you serious?

""Yessir I am. You do not have my permission to cross my threshold until I've heard, in normal human octaves, exactly what it is that you are expecting me to perform for you yourself."" I answered his unspoken question without a drop of sarcasm- guess the moon won't be rising tonight, after all.

Something inhuman passed across his features, a flat, dark look, seeming to reshape how his face molded together.

Then it was gone and he stepped forward and across my threshold as if it was nonexistent. And it most assuredly was not, given all of the hours and days I had toiled to make sure this place was as much a home in the proper sense as any other in the world.

""Mister Dresden, despite my name and its role in history, I do not have unlimited time at my side to spare with fencing words at one another like this. The window to interfere grows smaller with every minute of time that passes forward. Do you understand me?"" He asked sharply.

I narrowed my eyes at his own tone. ""What do you want?"" I repeated.

One hand clenched into a fist, but he pressed his emotions back down under the mask he wore, and with a gesture the door at his back slammed closed again. With that done Khronos stared back at me with those too-wide pupils for several seconds, as if weighing his words before delivering them.

""As you are well aware, their is no law prohibiting transition throughout the flow of time. It is, I believe your kind views, a task deemed more or less futile due to the weight and speed with which the current runs. You would need a significant degree of opposite and surpassing strength to wade through it.""

I nodded once. A mortal wizard could, at best, and at the risk of burning their life out for it as all too many hopeless schmucks had proven throughout history, make a localized journey backwards or forwards in time to within about fifteen minutes, provided you had enough juice built up to draw upon.

It took less to speed your perception of time up or slow it down rather than try to overcome it altogether, but I could manage a jump to within a few minutes, provided Demonreach was willing to comply and supply the necessary oomph.

""Unlike you mortals, our kind have a firmer understanding. My brethren and I are more than capable of sundering the current flow and forcing it unto a separate path- which we have already done all too often. Do you understand?"" He asked.

""No."" I answered simply. His face flitted through that dark, subhuman expression again, but Mouse let out a low growl in the back of his throat, and the deity's eyes locked onto my Foo dog's for a long moment.

Then he exhaled tiredly and leaned against the steel door. I frowned.

""Say that you and yours decided to divert a river, and your first decision is to create a dam to block it. The river is soon caught up and overflowing, if done improperly, and spills back along the way that it came to some degree. Drainage ditches are created to divert some of the river aside, but a lack of attention insures that the ditch is filled to the brim before it is ready, and soon runs freely over the lay of the land. Before you can stop it, the land is flooded, taking with it so many lives, and the only choice is to destroy what is built of the dam to return the river to its natural course in the hope of releasing the land of its damage. To some degree the flood has already reentered into the empty river bed, but as the water level slowly diminishes, pockets and pools and even perhaps a lake or two are left standing behind, alone, separated. Due to the casualties already sustained, you lack the necessary force to remove these unsightly and wasteful pools, and over time, they stagnate and decay, and disease accumulates within them that spreads to the surrounding area.""

Khronos managed to say all of that without once needing to stop and breath, and I gaped at him, even as my mind processed his message and the underlying point. After a few seconds I got it. ""You're saying that time has been broken up like that?"" I asked him.

The deity nodded. ""I am alone among my kind these days, Harry Dresden. There is little enough that I may do about this as such, though I may still step upon the surface of time and trek back and forth as an observer.""

""So what happens when a..."" I struggled to wrap my",candidate00002
"the kind of salary those terms said he was willing to pay me to sign up as his hit-wizard.

Oh, I had no illusions as to what he really wanted my more-than-marginal talents for, but the contract laying there was quite circumspect in the wording.

And outside of that one little flaw, I'll admit that it felt pretty damn good thinking of what my life could be like in the nominal hours.

And yet, for every pro that I could find, the cons that came with being an wizard in this century knocked them back down a few pegs; what good was a fancier apartment or, more than likely, an actual house, if I'd just burn out the water heater and electrical systems within a day?

What could I do with a better mode of transportation if it would just breakdown and cost me a small fortune to repair? The Blue Beetle was slow and my god, was it an embarrassment to drive around in, but I could reasonably rely on it to get me there on time when it counted for what for.

No. Housing and transportation were non-factors in this equation, and the only things I could measure the potential deal in the making by were the other aspects of my life that could be impacted.

My reputation with Chicago PD's Special Investigations unit wasn't at an all time high at the moment, and what little I had regained since the Sells' incident wasn't enough to mend the fence with Karrin Murphy, which meant that I wasn't going to be looking to them for a case and the usual exorbitant-per-hour quota I used to get for my services semi-frequently.

Without that, I was already past-due on this month's rent, to say nothing of the next month's.

But even still, I could probably scrounge up something from somewhere to get through by the skin of my teeth, just as I had in the days before becoming SI's consultant.

What ultimately changed my mind about immediately rejecting Marcone's deal and telling him to shove it was the effect his name carried with it in spoken circles.

When news spread that Gentleman Johnny Marcone was coming through a section of Chicago, the rest of the criminals with two braincells to rub together took their illegal activities to another section of the town, and though I hated to admit it, he wielded his considerable political clout like a surgeon would a scalpel; in four years, he had never been successfully charged with a single case in court.

Was he innocent? Define 'innocent' in full legalese and hope your lawyer happens to speak as fluently in bullshido.

As for anyone else that was stupid enough to hang around and try to duke it out with him outside of the courts, they usually found out why Marcone had won out over the Jamaicans and Vargassi family those four years ago.

The name 'Harry Dresden', on the other hand, was typically accompanied with skeptic stares and unpleasant muttering about my hourly rates, even when I provided the services agreed to by those desperate enough to ask for my help.

And dammit if that doesn't grate on my nerves more than almost anything else in the world.

I'm trying to save lives and help the little guy out along the way, but most of the time, the little guy is too busy adamantly refusing to acknowledge reality until it takes a bite out of their head one midnight stroll to offer even common courtesy.

And that wasn't even accounting for the vast opinion of the White Council.

Even now, with the Doom of Damocles lifted at last and by their own reluctant order, I was viewed my many of my fellow and older council-members as a danger to the Council's reputation at the best of times, and a volatile threat at the worst.

Exhaling, I nodded my head.

I wouldn't sign up to help Johnny Marcone under normal circumstances.

I wouldn't want to disappoint my teacher or the views of magic he had instilled in me after helping to spare my life about a seven or eight years ago.

But there were times when he had mentioned the lesser of two evils, and if Marcone didn't put me on the tab now, than who would he turn to next?

I knew enough wizards of the White Council to know that none of them would agree, and nor would they take kindly to his trying.

More likely, he'd find another Victor Sells somewhere, easily lured in by the money and having no compunctions whatsoever about murder, and then I'd be up to my neck in bloodshed that I could have avoided.

I picked up the sheet of fine paper and scanned the terms printed there again, frowning at the lack of casual-loopholes, and picking up the pen, I scratched through two or three lines I found unappealing before setting the sheet back down and facing him.

Marcone examined them and sighed quietly beneath his breath. ""I had wondered if you would even understand the meaning behind those words, Mister Dresden,"" he said with a light condescension in his tone.

I scowled",candidate00002

Right now Misha is at home with Vicki and the kids and Jensen is with Jared in his trailer, home too far away for just one night. The polling stations are closing state by state, and the map on the big screen tv, with its mostly red and not enough blue blocks, is a constantly evolving yet horrifying nightmare. It’s too much like watching a deadly train wreck in slow motion.

There are two simultaneous Skype chats open – Danneel and Gen on one laptop, curled up together on the couch at Jared’s place, evidence of future generations in their swollen bellies, and the other a picture of Misha’s living room with Vicki on the floor, her back against the couch and Misha pacing with a twisted look on his face that Jensen isn’t sure if he even recognises. Jensen tries to place it. He’s seen Misha both sad and angry, and although there’s a measure of both there, neither is quite fitting. When Misha turns to face him and their eyes lock, the only word that comes to him is disgust. Disgust at the man who is turning his beloved country into a freak show. Disgust at the blind half of that same country that seems to think the sun shines out of his racist, misogynistic, homophobic ass. And Jensen’s heart breaks as he realizes he even sees disgust in Misha’s beautiful blue eyes at himself for not doing enough to stop it.

 

Wednesday – Sadness

The day after is the hardest. Jensen needs to be on set early so he Facetimes both Danneel and Misha first thing, one right after another. No, neither of them has really slept. Yes, they’ve already spoken to each other. Neither of these facts surprises Jensen. His wife’s beautiful inner strength and ability to see things with positivity buoys him a little and he’s eternally grateful she’s his and that’s she’s empathic enough to know that Misha would have needed that strength this morning.

Misha is a wreck. Jensen isn’t sure what he expected, but broken wasn’t it. He can hear the crack in Misha’s voice as he tries to relay some cute story of Maison’s escapades with maple syrup that morning, but as much as Misha adores his little girl, Jensen can tell it’s just a distraction – a distraction from waking up to a new reality. It’s a reality Misha put so much of his heart and soul into to trying to prevent and Jensen can see in the liquid blue eyes that his heart is in pieces. It’s taking every ounce of willpower Jensen has not to just hop onto Highway 1 and head south. Misha is so close, yet so far in this moment and Jensen needs to help him, in a more physical way. What he’s doing now isn’t enough. It will never be enough.

Mid-morning, Misha posts a fifteen second video on Facebook and Jensen’s heart breaks. He can tell by the comments that fandom is hurting with him. They care so much for Misha – well most of them – and he has never been so glad for Misha’s ability to look past the hate. He will only see the good in people like always and he’ll be lifted by the heartfelt love that his fans are sending. He’s never considered them fans really, just friends, and that’s fitting right now because he needs all the friends he can get.

Jensen heads back to his trailer to make a quick phone call. He needs to hear Misha’s voice. He needs to tell him that he loves him – that he believes in him, and that no matter what, they’re in this together.

 

Thursday – Anger

Misha’s back on set on Thursday and Jensen is beyond relieved. They’re never good at being apart, but the last few days have been agonizing. When he left Misha on Sunday in New Jersey, he’d been foolishly complacent, almost to the point of wondering why Misha and Darius were even bothering with their trip to Ohio. Hillary had this, right? The online polls all showed it was practically in the bag. How had he been so stupid?

The day begins with desperate kisses in Misha’s trailer. With the pent up emotion of the past four days, it’s not surprising that it turns physical. What starts as clinging quickly ends up as fucking, and awareness barely kicks in before they’re both panting and coming and Misha is slipping out of Jensen and flopping down beside him on his unmade bed.

Jensen can still see the sadness from the day before, but there’s something else there today as well. It’s not until later, when they’ve made it through the first half of their shooting day, had their lunch break, checked the reaction tweets from that night’s episode (and somehow Dean has fittingly killed Hitler), that Misha tweets as himself for only the second time since Monday. He’s fucking angry. Misha berates",candidate00003
"Hey!  Nice to meet you.” Jensen mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck.  It was a nervous habit he had, one that even bled into his Dean persona, and Misha recognised it for exactly what it was.  “How do you know Misha and Vicki?”

Jeff seemed to cozy up a little closer to Vicki as he took his time answering Jensen’s question.  Vicki pulled away a bit, clearly uncomfortable about something.  “We’ve known each other for years; met on a retreat in Thailand, actually.  We spent a lot of time together before West here was born.” he leaned over to muss up West’s hair and the boy giggled.

Misha glanced over to where Jensen was staring at the laptop screen, hoping the innuendo in Jeff’s comment had gone over his head, but Misha could see in Jensen’s eyes exactly when the full extent of what Jeff was hinting at crossed his friend’s mind.

Jensen quickly backed up to the door of the trailer, almost tripping over the leg of a small table in his haste to leave, but yet not willing to take his eyes off Misha’s worried face.  Misha felt like a deer in the headlights, stunned silent and unsure of what to say or do, just knowing that he had to fix this, had to come up with an answer to the questioning expression on his lover’s face that was currently boring into his soul.

“Jen, wait!  Please?”

Jensen chose that moment to break eye contact and turn around, heading out the door and letting the metal screen spring back with a bang, causing it to echo across the industrial looking lot.  Misha slammed the laptop shut, knowing his empathic wife would totally understand his need to go after Jensen.  He had some explaining to do to get him to understand the part of him and Vicki’s past that they hadn’t opened up about in detail with Jensen or Jared.

It had clouded over again in the short time since Misha had been outside.  There was an ominous feel to the greyness that matched the hard lump in his chest as his footsteps clanged down the metal steps of his trailer. He glanced around the lot, taking in the familiar scene of the crew at work loading props, the flatbeds of equipment being readied for the location shoot later that night, the cars in the parking lot, and the PA’s and assistants milling around.  The place felt like a second home to Misha after eight years, but even that familiarity wasn’t calming his racing heart.  Right now, his biggest priority was making things right with the man that he loved.  Yes, that was it; he was in love with Jensen, and the fear of possibly losing that love so soon after realizing it was tearing him apart.

His first stop was Jensen’s trailer.  It seemed like the obvious place the man would go if he wanted to be alone, but there was no sign of him and the door was locked.  Misha ran to the food tent, glancing around and only seeing a handful of people grabbing coffee at an hour too early for lunch.  Checking the make-up and wardrobe trailers proved fruitless as well.  No one had seen Jensen and Misha was becoming frantic.  As a last resort, he checked Jared’s trailer.  Maybe Jensen hadn’t wanted to be alone with his thoughts after all.

Jared answered Misha’s incessant knocking and just opened the door wide to let him in.  “I’m gonna go lift for a bit at the gym.  You guys should talk.”

Misha glanced over to the couch where Jensen sat, head in his hands, looking as dejected as Misha had ever seen him.

Misha nodded.  “Thanks, Jar.”

Jared pulled him into a side hug, enveloping him as only Jared could.  “You bet, brother.  Fix this, okay?  I don’t know what happened here, but you’re my best friends and I need you both to be happy.”

Misha closed the door gently behind Jared and leaned back against it, watching the expression on Jensen’s face and waiting to see if he would speak first.  Although he got that Jensen had been blindsided by Jeff, it’s not like the other man didn’t have at least a vague idea about he and Vicki’s past.  He could see that something had gotten under Jensen’s skin, but he needed to know exactly what so he could understand and attempt to make it right.

When it became clear that Jensen wasn’t going to be the one to start the conversation, Misha walked over and gently perched on the arm of the couch.  Fearful of making an unwelcome advance, he stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned to face the man in front of him.  “Jensen?  Talk to me.  Please?”

Jensen raised his head to look at him and Misha could see the hurt in his eyes.  Not touching wasn’t an option.  Misha slid down onto the couch cushion and wrapped his arms around the man beside him, pulling him close against his chest.  To Misha’s",candidate00003
"unexpected, and after the previous weekend, more than a little awkward. Jensen moved forward, side-stepping Misha in the processed, and closed the apartment door behind them. “What are you doing here, Mish?”

Misha wandered into the small kitchen and grabbed a half-finished craft beer from the counter. He lifted it up to show Jensen. “Want one? Then we can talk.”

Jensen nodded, shrugging of his damp jacket and slinging it over the back of the couch. He joined his friend by the fridge, taking the offered bottle and tipping it back between his lips. He ran his fingers through his damp hair and looked up at Misha who, much like his onscreen counterpart, hadn’t stopped staring directly at him since he’d walked in.

The look of pure desire darkening Misha’s crystal blue eyes caught Jensen off guard. He observed his friend’s interested gaze roam from the bottle at his lips, down his chest and arms, to his crotch; his jeans slightly damp from where his jacket hadn’t covered below the waist. Jensen’s dick twitched in response to the scrutiny, not an unwelcome reaction, just not the one he needed right now when they really needed to talk.

Jensen turned towards the living room, needing to release himself from Misha’s heated stare. “Misha, you still haven’t told me why you’re here. Really.”

Misha followed him and took a seat on the leather couch, patting the space beside him. “Sit down, Jen. Sounds like you’re having second thoughts about what happened between us up at Whistler. Talk to me. You can tell me anything. You know that.”

Jensen took a seat beside his friend, careful not to get too close. He needed to keep his head clear, and lord knows Misha’s close proximity was already making that difficult. He looked up at Misha and saw the concerned and troubled look in his eyes. That was all it took for him to realize he needed to clear the doubt in his friend’s mind.

“It’s not so much second thoughts, Mish,” Jensen started, voice cracking slightly. “I loved what we did! It was such an amazing weekend and I can’t thank you enough for opening my eyes to the possibilities between us. I’ve ignored it for too long. It’s more…guilt, you know?”

“Yes, I think I get it. Vicki and I have always viewed love and monogamy as something that can be shared with the right person; that opening your heart to another only increases love and passion as long as everyone is on the same page. You weren’t raised that way. You come from a traditional, Christian family, Jen. You’ve been taught that you give yourself to your one and only for life. It’s really difficult to go against years of conditioning. “

Jensen sighed with relief. Misha did get it even if he hadn’t at first. “I think that’s exactly it. I know Danneel’s good with it. Hell, when I told her about our adventure in the hot tub I think she was actually excited about it. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was getting off on the idea like all the fan girls on Twitter,” he laughed, blushing from his chest to the tips of his ears.

“The ladies do enjoy the idea of two men together, Jen.”

Jensen nodded. “Yeah, I know man. Damn, have you seen that Cockles tag? Some of the fan art and photo manips are intense!”

Misha laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “Have you read any of the fan fiction?”

“They write about us? Not just Destiel?”

“Oh yeah, Jen. I’ll have to check out Tumblr and find you a bedtime story one night,” Misha replied, his gummy grin widening. Jensen couldn’t help but smile at his friend’s infectious laughter.”

“Sounds like I need to get with the program then. My wife loves the idea, your wife is on board, the fans are all over it, only thing holding us back is me apparently.”

“I’m not pushing you,” Misha reminded. “This is on your terms, if at all. I can’t say I won’t be disappointed if you don’t want to take this any further, but I get it.”

“Misha, if there’s one thing I’m sure of, it’s that I want you. Fuck, you make me feel desired and wanted in a way that’s so different from Danni, you know?”

Misha closed the distance between them, climbing effortlessly into Jensen’s lap, lifting Jensen’s chin with a single long finger and staring determinedly into his friend’s eyes. “Oh yes, Jen. I definitely know.”

Their lips crashed together with instant heat. Jensen groaned into the kiss, bucking his half hard erection into Misha’s, completely on board with the current",candidate00003
", leaving him and Misha alone for a moment before the crowds moved in.  “Thanks for the post-its yesterday, babe.  You’re spoiling me,” Jensen whispered, slipping his hand in Misha’s and giving it a quick squeeze.  “I enjoyed one of your kisses last night, right before I had to fix my short-sheeted bed.”  Misha pulled him in for a hug.  “You know you love me anyway.”  They reluctantly pulled apart and Jensen nodded with a soft smile.  “Now get out of here and let me work, Dmitri.”    “As you wish, Jackles,” Misha smirked, and turned to sneak out the side door.  Jensen went to grab his phone out of his back pocket to check for any texts before starting the photo op line, and stuck to it was yet another post-it, this time yellow, and a few hand-written words.  ‘You said your heart was a trapdoor.  We kept falling through.’ – Rebecca Lindenberg  If the first few fans wondered why Jensen had such a sappy smile on his face in their photo ops, it would only be speculation anyway.  Jensen soon found out that post-it notes were a bit of a Vegas convention theme.  With the memory loss episode having just aired that week, fans had jumped on the bandwagon in photo ops and he and Jared were being stuck with the damn things all day.  He couldn’t help but smile when he realized that Misha had been ahead of the game.  It didn’t surprise him.  The man was always a leader, never a follower.  The pace of the afternoon went quickly.  Photos, meet and greet, afternoon panel, then more photos.  He loved conventions.  He genuinely enjoyed spending time with the fans, his SPN family, but it was exhausting as well.  He stopped in the green room for a Redbull before heading up for photo ops with Misha.  Jensen always wanted to be on his game for those.  The fans loved their playful interactions, and so did he.  Misha and Jared were just finishing up when he entered through the side door.  He stood to the side, moving his hips to the music, watching the last few fans enjoy their time with his friends.  The few seconds they got with their idols was so important to them, it always warmed his heart.  Even after so many years, it still amazed him the impact the show had on people; the family that they’d somehow created.  It was humbling and something he was insurmountably proud of.  While he’d been lost in thought, the photo op line had finished, and Misha and Jared had wandered over.  “What cloud was your head lost on?” Jared asked, between chugs from a bottle of water.  Jensen shook his head to clear it.  “Just appreciating what we have.”  Misha nodded, clearly understanding where Jensen was coming from.  “So, Jen.  You ready to go play Destiel?”  “Pretty sure most of the time they have us playing ourselves, Mish.  You know that, right?”  “Of course,” Misha smirked.  “So let’s go give them what they want.”  Jared rolled his eyes.  “You two are gross and I’m outta here before the eye-fucking starts.”   Jensen figured that was their cue to be as gross as possible in sort of polite company, at least in front of volunteers and Chris, so he tipped his head onto Misha’s shoulder and fluttered his eyelashes directly at Jared.  His giant friend backed out of the room with his hands in the air as if to say, I give up.  Jensen grabbed Misha possessively by the arm and danced them over to the backdrop.  “Let’s do this!”  Photo ops with Misha were always the most fun.  They chose some upbeat classic rock and Chris played along.  Some of the poses requested of them were ridiculous, and some were downright dirty.  Some they had to say no to just on principle, but others they had fun with.  The ones where they needed to be close, they often took advantage of, touching each other as much as they could get away with, squeezing hands, rubbing shoulders, caressing chests; they played it up for the fans, and they enjoyed it for each other.   About half way through the line, they stopped for a moment to grab a few sips of water from the nearby table.  Jensen slipped his phone from his back pocket and swiped to check for messages as he had a tendency to do whenever he had a minute – a habit he’d gotten into since becoming a father.  All he’d missed was a recent text from Misha.  He glanced up at the man in question who just gave him a knowing grin.  Tapping to open the text, all he saw was a photo of another post-it, this one bright blue.  Jensen enlarged the photo to be able to read the writing on the note.  “You must not ever stop being whimsical. And you must not, ever, give anyone else the responsibility for your life.” – Mary Oliver  Jensen couldn’t help but place",candidate00003
"his racing heart and will down his semi-hard cock.  He didn’t need to get himself hurt because he wasn’t paying attention.  A few deep breaths later, he let Sid know he was ready and he got himself into position.

Jensen intentionally avoided looking in Misha’s direction when Sid shifted the lever to edge Larry onto high speed.  The difference was obvious but manageable.  He had to work at keeping himself seated on the bull this time, which would make the take look realistic.  When the bull slowed at the end of the eight seconds, he was hopeful they could finish in one take.  His thighs were beginning to ache from clenching, and his arm was getting tired from being held up so long.  He was reminded yet again that he was no longer twenty-two.

There was some shuffling around before the next ride as the crew got ready to film.  Jensen chanced a peek at Misha and was surprised to see the man no longer there.  Deciding that was probably for the best, he centered all of his focus on getting the scene done in one take.  One of the stylists came over to brush some powder on his face and fluff up his hair.  Then, it was only a matter of minutes before the scene was called and Jensen rode his ride like the pro-Cowboy Dean would try to be.  As an afterthought, he flopped backwards as the bull slowed, knowing it would stretch his shirt across his abs and show off his belt buckle.  It seemed right in the moment, like something Dean would do.  Whether they’d use it or not, who knew. 

After catching his breath, Jensen rolled to the side just in time to see a mop of dark hair disappear out the door.  He kept rolling until he landed flat on his back on the safety mat that occupied the section of the bar that surrounded the mechanical bull.

“Hey, John?  Am I good for a while?”  Jensen groaned, really starting to feel some muscles he didn’t know he had as he struggled to get to his feet.

“For sure!  You’ve got at least a couple of hours until we need you again.  We’ve got lunch and then Jared’s coverage.  I’ll watch the time and sent one of the PA’s over when I’ve got a better estimate,” John replied, already nose deep in the script for the next scene.

Jensen scrambled off the uneven mat and wandered over to the bar to grab a bottle of water.  As he walked he reached around to pull his phone out of his back pocket.  He swiped the screen and saw he had a couple of texts from Danneel just to say hi and wish him luck with Larry, a missed call from his agency, and a text from Misha. 

Your trailer – M

The last flushed look on Misha’s face, the clenched fist, the roll of his hips came flooding back and Jensen didn’t need to be told twice.  He stuffed the phone back in his pocket, took a giant swig of water, and strode purposely out towards his trailer.

The man in question was sitting on the unmade bed, nose buried in something on his phone.  Jensen dropped his own phone and keys on the counter and strolled over, enjoying the indignant look on Misha’s face when he grabbed the offending phone out of his hand and pushed him backwards, easily straddling his thighs.  He held the phone high up in the air, out of Misha’s reach.

“Oh my God, Jen.  I’ve seen you in that exact position so many times today,” Misha teased, clearly enjoying the view of Jensen in such a familiar pose.  “Thighs clenched, arm in the air showing off the lines of your body.  I swear you were just doing it to make me crazy.”  He punched the last few words with a slight roll of his hips, apparently just to make his point.

Misha’s tone had changed from light and teasing to suggestive and heated.  Jensen tossed the phone to the side and leaned down to bracket Misha’s head with his arms.

 “Well, I would say I did it all for you, Dmitri, but since you weren’t supposed to be on set today…”  Jensen’s train of thought was interrupted when Misha swallowed, highlighting his unshaven jaw. Inhaling Misha’s scent as he leaned in, Jensen relished the feel of Misha’s whiskers tickling his chin and cheeks.  He nipped and licked his way around the shell of Misha’s ear and then down the side of his neck to where his shirt collar halted his progress.  Sitting back up, he worked the buttons on Misha’s shirt, reclaiming a little of his power of speech as he did so.

“So, yeah.  Uh, why are you here anyway?”

Misha’s breaths grew shorter as Jensen’s feather light touches flicked his shirt buttons open.  “Uh, needed to drop some Nexus paperwork off at the border. Figured I’d stop by and see you.”

Jensen pressed the heel of his palm into the",candidate00003
"and the last time we spoke you made it quite clear I was to stay away from you and your problems.” 

Dean didn’t know where to start. There were too many things to say and there had been too much already left unsaid. Dean sighed. “I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”

 “I assure you I’m fine. Thank you.”

Cas’ formal tone was a little unexpected. Dean had assumed they would fall back into comfortable friendship. He found himself more than a little frustrated with Cas’ apparent disregard for something Dean thought had been important to both of them but he supposed he had some amends he needed to make before he could expect anything different.

“Cas,” Dean started, stopping just as quickly and turning to look straight into Cas’ solemn face.

With little regard to how Cas might react, Dean took a deep breath and began to speak. With the culmination of his feelings over the past years mingled with his frustration in Cas’ apparent lack of caring, he found himself suddenly spilling out everything he needed to say. 

“I’m so sorry! I needed to make sure you weren’t still hurt. I needed to know if the last few days affected you the same way they did me because I’ve been beating myself up inside wondering if I’m ever even gonna see you again, man. I had to see if you cared enough to come back; if our friendship meant anything to you.” Dean’s gaze drifted downwards and wondered if he would regret his next words. “I had to find out if you think about me in the same way I dream about you. I had to know, Cas, because the not knowing is tearing me apart.”

Dean sank to the floor. His fear of rejection prevented him from looking up. He fully expected Cas to leave him there, slumped on the floor, shivering in the admission of his feelings, knowing that he had just laid everything he had ever known on the line in just a few short minutes.

It seemed like a lifetime he sat on the threadbare rug with his head on his knees. The light touch on his shoulder surprised him and his heartbeat quickened at the gesture. Cas was still there after everything Dean had just said.

“Dean.” Dean looked up slowly, in awe at the sudden change in Cas’ tone.

Cas slid his fingers gently down Dean’s arm, just a feather-light touch, eventually reaching his hand and pulling the shaking man to his feet. Standing face to face, Cas lightly ran his palm down Dean’s cheek to his chin and lifted his face with just one soft finger until their eyes met.

Dean leaned into Cas’ touch. “You were the one thing I could count on, Cas. I never expected to feel this way, not about you, not about anyone really, but the truth is I do, and now I don’t know how to act, or think, or what to do and frankly it scares the hell outta me.” 

Dean held his breath as Cas closed the last of the distance between them and brushed his lips against Dean’s in the lightest of kisses, a barely audible sigh escaping as he melted against him. Dean felt his body relax with sweet relief as he leaned in to return the kiss. His hands automatically found their way behind Cas’ head, feathering his fingers into Cas’ unruly hair.

“Cas,” Dean whispered, his body automatically reacting to the closeness he had denied himself for so long and that he so desperately needed. He gently brought his hands around, cradling Cas’ face in his palms and captured the angel’s warm, dry lips with his own yet again. This kiss was more urgent. His head was spinning and he realized his hands were shaking as his emotions caught up with the actions of his body. Cas’ hand moved around to the jut of Dean’s hip, tugging him closer by his belt loop.

“I never realized,” Cas murmured against Dean’s cheek, stubble grazing. “I wanted you. For so many years I got your attention the only way I knew how. Then we became friends and I needed you, needed this, but I didn’t know how to ask.”

Dean was flooded with feeling at Cas’ unexpected words. How he wished he known. Maybe that would have given him the strength he needed to do this then. Maybe it would have changed the way things were now.

“Shhhhhh,” Dean whispered, his breath warming Cas’ cheek. “We’re here now, and that’s all that matters.” 

With those words he kissed Cas again with months, years, of pent up emotion and need. His tongue parted Cas’ flushed lips and found heat and warmth inside.

Cas kissed back with just as much urgency, allowing Dean’s tongue to sweep across his tongue and teeth. His hands found the hem of Dean’s old t-shirt and slid underneath, finding toned muscles and soft flesh. Dean’s",candidate00003
"clavicle, softly scratching with his chin until he reached a firm nipple, wasting no time catching it between his teeth and biting down gently.

Jensen cried out at the pain and pleasure of it. “Shit! Yessss!” He was so fucking thankful Misha knew not to be gentle with him after so long. He’d need softness later, and Jensen knew he’d get it, but right now he wanted to feel it. He was desperate and aching and he craved hard and raw.

Misha had worked his way down to Jensen’s hip bones, leaving whisker burn and teeth marks in his wake. Jensen was rock hard against his stomach and leaking a wet spot on his boxer briefs, but Misha just ignored his cock for now, choosing instead to switch sides and give the other hip the same treatment. Once Jensen was marked up to his satisfaction, Misha tugged the waistband of his briefs as her went and nuzzled his prickly chin over Jensen’s balls wasting no time in licking a stripe up the underside of his cock.

“Fuck. I will never not be surprised by that fucking tongue, baby,” Jensen groaned. “It’s almost as long as my dick!”

Misha chuckled around the tip of Jensen’s rigid cock as he mouthed around the top, tonguing at the slit, obviously enjoying the breathy moans he was eliciting from Jensen at his actions. “Sounds like that’s a compliment to both of us,” he replied, before sucking Jensen all the way down to the base.

Jensen had to fist his hands into the sheets to stop himself from thrusting into the warm suction of Misha’s wicked mouth. He knew Misha could take it, hell, he knew Misha loved it when Jensen fucked up into his face, but Misha hadn’t asked yet and Jensen would try to hold back until he did.

He glanced up to see Misha staring at him, blue eyes dark with lust. Jensen could feel the heat starting to pool in his belly from just watching the mop of sex-crazed dark hair bobbing up and down leaving his dick damp with saliva and Misha’s lips moist and stretched wide.

Before Jensen could get too caught up in the repetitiveness of one sensation, he a felt the pad of finger press firmly against his hole. There was no attempt to push inside, just a firm pressure – a solid presence of, yes. Yes, right there.

Misha pulled off, fisting Jensen’s cock instead to free up his mouth and worked his way down to suck each of Jensen’s balls into his mouth, circling them one at a time with his talented tongue and surrounding them with warm, wet heat. Jensen groaned at the roughness of Misha’s stubble against his perineum, sensitivity overload making it difficult to articulate what he wanted – but Misha knew. Misha always knew. The long, slender fingers surrounding his cock stopped stroking, leaving him sitting wet and heavy against his belly and suddenly there were two strong, eager hands on the flesh of his ass spreading him wide.

Jensen held his breath. They’d only done this once before and it had blown him away, sending him into almost instantaneous orgasm as soon as Misha had reached up and nudged his dick. Eager at the prospect, Jensen scrambled to turn over. Even as Misha maneuvered their limbs into place he was shoving his own underwear down – apparently glad to be rid of them.

Jensen was soon feeling the insistent tug of his elastic waist band being pulled over his cheeks and the warmth of their cocoon was lost into the room. The cooler air hitting his cheeks was a rush of sensation. Spreading his knees apart to make room for Misha, he arched his back and pulled his ass into the air. He didn’t consider the neediness of the act; he didn’t have to. That was one thing he’d grown to love about being with Misha, there was simply no shame. Misha encouraged his desires without judgement or preconceived ideas and he lived to bring them both pleasure.

“Please, Mish,” Jensen keened, feeling his ass quiver in anticipation. He could feel his friend leaning up over him and heard Misha let out a soft rumble of contented laughter as he scritched his beard over ready cheek mounds.

Jensen snickered, though the sound was muffled in his pillow, fueled by his lover’s playful mood. He felt strong hands clamp down and shove him into the mattress and waited for what he knew was coming – a warm, wet tongue dragging down between his cheeks.

He was putty now, putty in Misha’s capable hands. He let his limbs go numb as he felt his underwear tugged the rest of the way down his legs. Then a shot of electricity shot up his spine as he felt fingers peeling his cheeks apart.

A moment later, the scruff was back. It tickled its way up his inner thighs and prickled the tender skin of his perineum before hot breath finally passed over his hole. Beneath him, pressed into the bedding, his cock pulsed with excitement as a flicking of tongue teased his entrance and he felt his hole twitching in response",candidate00003

Gil looked over and Uma and thought "" Harry's into this Pain? His kink is pain?!?"" Uma nodded as she  Leaned back into her chair, watching the show Unfold.

"all and that's that. 




He had went to the doctor's after school, despite his father saying he was fine. But after the boy had shown his father the petals His father had taken him to the doctor. It was quiet as he was in the hallway, He was sitting in a chair with his head down. His father was inside the office talking to the doctor. The two words still was Ringing in Ethan's head. Hanahaki disease. The name sounded pretty sure but this wasn't pretty at all. Why him, Ethan didn't dersve this. All he wanted was love, He gave his heart to another but Didn't get it in return. That was the problem. He had gotten it From loving Jason, who loved Piper. It was all his fault. From what Ethan could hear though the door there was ways to get it out, The only two options were Love back or surgery. Either way It wasn't gonna happen. Sure, Ethan's father had tons of money but it all went to his younger sister, Who had cancer. 


Ethan coughed and looked at the petals in his hands. ""What now?'' Will asked as Nico Took a sip out of his coffee. The five of them were hanging out in star bucks, Just Will, Nico, Ethan, Luke and Hazel. Ethan shrugged and wiped his mouth. ""Man you need hearing aids. I said I have the Hanahaki disease, which by the way means I have flowers and roots in me.""' Ethan shrugged again. His friends just gaped at him and he rubbed the back of his neck. ""But how do you get it?'' Luke questioned, He already knew but Ethan had a feeling he was helping him tell what had to be said, and for that The one eyed boy was grateful. ""When you love someone so much and they don't feel the same.'' He replied quietly. Hazel put her hand over his hand and smiled, but it was full of pity and sadness. ""I could get them removed surgery but then I will never feel love again.'' He muttered and felt all his friend's eyes on him. Before anyone could say something Ethan erupted into violent coughing, He coughed right into his hands and looked at them sadly. Blood was covering the petals. ""Et, You have to tell Jason! He-''

""Might return the feelings then? Bull. It's utter bullshit Will.'' Ethan muttered and wiped his mouth. His coffee sat there growing cold as He felt himself dying. ""I want nothing to do with...With..Jason at the moment.'' He didn't miss the way his voice caught on his name. No matter what he told himself he still Loved Jason Grace. What a cruel joke on him. ""Ethan...can't you...I don't know..'' Hazel asked and Ethan looked at her, One of his best friends. He smiled and shrugged. ""Who knows?'' He felt horrible for doing this. He was basically letting himself die right in front of them.


 He had nightmares. Where he would wake up and find himself covered in petrels, find roots growing out of him. He would always wake up in a cold sweat, Gasping and curled up in a ball. His younger sister didn't understand. He would just pat her head and smile. ""I'm fine Yuri, Just a little sickness.'' And she would look up at him with her bright green eyes wide. ""A sickness?'' She asked in a quiet voice. And this is the part where it killed Him. He would get on his knees and hold her close and blinked away tears. '""Yeah, I'll be fine soon so you don't worry at all Yuri.'' He didn't want to lie to her, But he had to Lie, he didn't want her to worry. She was only eight and already was sentenced with a horrible fate. Her mother had die when she was only five when their mother died, Ethan and her were driving home from his Karate match when a drunk driver crashed into them. Ethan lost a eye, and Their mother had lost her life. 



Life was cruel. 


""Ethan please, we can help.'' Will pleaded and the other three nodded. Ethan felt his heart break and he shrugged. They couldn't help, unless They somehow made Jason love him they couldn't do a single thing. And that was beautiful. Ethan looked at his phone and lied to their faces, he had said his father wanted him home. It wasn't that good of a lie but his friends let him go. It was raining so he put his hood up as he walked. His mind started to Travel to Jason and he shook his head. It was not the time nor place to think about the boy who was killing him without even realizing it. He stopped at the cross walk and looked up at the rainy sky. He hands were in his pockets and he had the sudden urge to walk in the traffic.",candidate00004
"said. ""I wanted to come back a little early. Why are you crying."" Luke asked,wrapping his arms around Ethan,who cuddled into him. ""Nightmare,Not a big deal."" Ethan reassured. Luke Just Said ""Spill."" Ethan sighed and said ""You know that One dream I had-The one with the fields of Punishment and Place for heroes? Had it again."" Luke hugged him tighter. ""Don't worry Et, it won't happen. I promise."" Luke said. ""What ever."" Ethan muttered. He listened to Luke's heart,Which for some reason Always calmed him down. Luke started to Fool around with Ethan's eyepatch. ""Cutie."" Luke said. Et closed his eye. ""Shut up. Your talking about yourself."" He murmured. Luke laughed and kissed Et's forehead. ""Noooo, I'm talking about you my kitten."" Luke said and Laughed even more at the look on Ethan face. ""I hate you."" Ethan swore and Kissed Luke. ""Now go to sleep ya stupid big Blond."" He added as Luke rolled his eyes. ""Alright Kitten."" Luke said and closed His eyes, He felt Ethan slowly Relax but Didn't go to sleep. He sighed and said ""Et, Want me to make some coffee?"" Ethan just Said ""I can do it."" Luke opened his eyes and kissed Ethan. ""Fine, But I'm putting in a movie."" Luke said and Ethan laughed. So they ended on the couch,Ethan Cuddling up to Luke, Their drinks-Tea for Ethan and Coffee for Luke-on the table, Watching a stupid movie, something Animated. ""But Et, That won't happen."" Luke said. ""I'll hold you to that."" Ethan said. Both of them watched movies until Morning.

Ethan felt warm arms around him. He groaned and snuggled to Luke. ""Hey Et, ya gotta get up."" Luke said, trying not to laugh at the smaller boy. He had a massive case of bed head and his eyepatch was crooked. ""I don't want to."" Ethan muttered into Luke's chest. Luke kissed his cheek. ""I know baby but ya gotta."" He said. Ethan yawned and got off of His boyfriend. He looked outside and saw it was snowing. ""It's snowing."" He stated. Luke laughed. ""You act like you never saw Snow before?"" He questioned. ""I have."" Ethan said and got up, before Large arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him back down. ""Luke! I thought you said we have to get up!"" Ethan groaned blushing softly. Luke cuddled him. ""Just a couple more minutes?"" He pleaded. ""Fine."" Ethan said, hiding his smile

Snow falling on him, he reached up and grabbed the only hand that helped him. The only hand that wanted him, needed him. With the snow mixed in with tears on his face he smiled and welcomed the hand,the arms that wrapped around him. He knew what the arms meant, they welcomed him. All he ever wanted was to let Kids not be like him, forced to Go to the bad side just so he could change the world. As he got pulled up he smiled at his only friend, the only friend that didn't care who he was the son of, didn't care about his race or eyepatch, just a friend. The snow faded and He realized where he was, a crystal beach, a place for heroes. He was a hero. Him and his best friend. He smiled and the arm, then at the body and then the face. ""Hey Luke."" He said,chocking up a little. Luke smiled and said ""hey Et, we lost."" Ethan nodded. ""But were here now, maybe the gods will change?"" Like said and Ethan smiled. ""Now and forever right?""  Ethan said. Both boys fell and started to laugh, then sob. But they were here together. That all that matter

Ethan Nakamura Remembered Exactly how he felt when he came to Hogwarts, he was scared, Nervous and A tad Pissed. One-WHY DIDNT ANY ONE TELL HIM HE WAS A WIZARD?!? Two, He doubted any one else had a eyepatch and Third, You would be nervous to if you found out your a wizard. He remembered Walking up to the Hat and Hearing ""Griffendor!"" He remembered Walking to the table and getting claps on the back. What Ethan will never remember Is a blond 3rd year slytherin boy watching him. Ethan Was still nervou, Atfer all this was all new to him. but he was shocked at the food that appeared-of course The kid could only think ""Magic ain't it?"" He could only stare with his mouth watering,until a black haired boy nudged him. ""Hey..you can eat dude."" The boy said and Piled Some weird looking food on Ethan plate. ""What..what is this?"" Ethan asked poking the food with his fork. The boy laughed. """,candidate00004
"He loved her, He loved her so much it hurts. A pain In his heart when ever she Smiled, He grew dizzy When she laughed. She was his light, and he was Her King. He loved her ever since He saw her. It took years,But he finally asked her out, she loved him back. When ever they could they would Hug. Sometimes Charlie Would sneak Into her cabin and they would Sit on the roof, Where they hugged and Kissed. Both were happy until He had to go, He had to go and Help with the war. She sobbed and Hit him, Until he wrapped his large arms around her and Said ""Ill come back."" Over and over Into her hair. He felt her tears soak his shirt, He knew deep down that he wouldn't come back. But he wasn't gonna tell her that. He told Her that he loved her, That she was His princess and He wouldn't ever leave her. She nodded and Charlie said ""I have a gift for you when I come back."" ""I want to go with you."" She said,Her voice was cracking. He nodded and smiled, then his princess kissed him-for the last time- and ran off. He almost broke down but never less  Left to get Percy. The whole time he was thinking ""You gave to come back, You will NOT die."" When he got caught He knew what to do. As his hand went to his watch he thought ""Im sorry Princess."" His last image was Selena Sitting on the dock, Her hair Over her shoulder as She held back a laugh, Her smile even beating the Sun. 

She didn't believe him, She couldn't face the truth though, She wanted to believe him but She knew the risks. It was likely He would die. She kissed him for the last time and Ran off. She cried For hours when she found out,Her king was dead. Nothing could make her feel better. When The Ares Cabin followed her into Battle, She thought of her King, Her Charlie. When the acid hit her She was proud, She proved that Her cabin- the cabin of Love could fight. As she closed her eyes on The mortal world they called Earth she thought of Her King. Charlie, I want to see you.

When both The female and Male opened their eyes, They were in each other arms. ""My princess."" Charlie Coked out as Selena hugged him. ""My king."" She said, her Tears Covering her beautiful Smile. ""My princess."" He began and Bent down on one knee. They could be together forever now. He brought a small box out of His pocket and said ""My princess, I love you until the stars end. My heart Pumps for you and you only. Let spend Entiry together."" He opened it and Put the ring on his Princess finger. They both started to cry  as Selina said ""I love you."" 

Later on, on the shores of the Place for Heroes, They kissed and Welcomed each other.",candidate00004
"That fucking Jew Was lying and Cartman knew it. So he was sitting down in front of Seven eleven Glaring at the ground with his arms shoving tons of food into his mouth. He kept cussing at everyone who passed him, no matter who it was. He just wanted that damn Car and he wanted it NOW. But his mom told him that he probably just misplaced it, so Cartman called her a bitch and then left, so here he was...in front of seven eleven... looking stupid. He was so mad and to busy stuffing his face to notice A boy with red and black hair sit next to him. ""Fucking Damn it! That's my Car!! I want my carrrrrr!!!!"" He cried.""What a pussy.. it's not even a real car."" Cartman looked around and when he saw the boy he Said ""Shut up shut up!!"" The boy flipped his hair and pulled out a cigarette. ""Alright."" He said as he lit it and the two of them sat in Total quiet until the boy said ""What's your name any ways?"" Cartman looked at him. ""I'm Cartman."" He answered in his Annyoning voice. ""I'm Pete."" The boy flipped his hair again and Cartman said ""Why are you bugging me?"" Pete sighed. ""You were yelling at Everyone and I couldn't smoke in peace you poser."" Cartman eyes went wide. ""What did you call me?!"" Pete snickered. ""A poser."" He answered. ""You fucker!!"" Cartman yelled as pete snickered again. ""Your being a baby over something stupid."" Cartman Growled. ""That's a lie! My car was amazing! Take that back you bitch!"" Pete looked at him and said ""Listen poser, Its just a car- a toy car. I literally don't see how it's so important."" Cartman threw himself on the ground and threw his limbs about. ""Shut up shut up shut up shut up!!!!"" Pete Looked at him. ""What ever."" He said and didn't pay any attention to the fat boy throwing his fit until He yelled ""fuck off Emo!!"" Pete's head snapped up as he glared at him. ""What?"" He said. ""You heard me!! Your acting like your life sucks! Mine is so much worse! I lost my toy!"" Cartman wailed. Pete glared at him and said ""Really now? Your life sucks!?"" Cartman nodded. Pete took a deep breath. ""Listen Fatty- just sit down and calm down."" Cartman shockily listened and sat back down. They both sat in quiet again as Pete kept smoking. Eric looked at him and said ""Your fucking stupid emo!"" Pete eye's twitched and he didn't look at him.  ""Listen...Cartman. How important is this toy to you?"" Cartman looked at him. ""Like really Important!"" He yelled and Pete Flinched. ""Don't yell poser, your hurting my ears. And if you want To get a new car then here."" The goth shoved Some cash into his Hands and Went back to smoking. ""Aw thanks dude!"" Eric said, he had already decided that he was gonna use that money to get food. ""Sucker!"" Eric thought as Pete started to talk ""I'm not emo.. Emos and goths are different, don't ask why cause I can't explain. And your throwing a fit over a toy? I know it's special to you but you have it good."" Cartman looked at him and said ""shut up Fag."" Pete eye twitched again and he said ""You have it really good. You have a house with a loving mom"" Eric rolled his eyes. ""Shut up emo!"" He said. Pete glared at him and Said ""Listen... Cartman... your mom loves you right? I don't get that. My mom... She left me."" Cartman looked at him. ""My dad And I live along....in a shitty Trailor, I smoke and do Drugs."" Cartman eyes went wide a little. ""Life sucks ass"" he said and Cartman got a idea. ""Life sucks ass right?"" He said. Pete nodded and Blew some Smoke into the sky. ""You wonder why I'm goth? I hate the world, The world hasn't been nice to me."" Pete said and cartman looked at him. He opned his mouth to say something But Pete cut him off. ""Oh look..I'm Eric Boo hoo hoo, my Mom spoilers me shit less and I get every thing i want!"" He mocked. Cartman Growled. ""Shut up emo!"" Pete flipped his hair. ""I'm Pete and I'm goth- I hate everything in this world and wouldn't you know! I have a shitty life compared to The god we all know as Eric Fucking Cartman!""  Then He threw his cigarette on the ground and pulled up his sleeves and showed some scars. ""HA! You at emo!"" Cartman yelled. Pete smiled and shook his head. ""Nope,",candidate00004
"quiet on the ship. 

""Fine.'' Cartman said, his greed winning over sense. Kenny smiled and the game began, Each was playing for a life. Each was aiming to win

okay guys! chapter two! So i'm planning on updating every week- HAHAHAHAHA- so this fan fic was inspired by the amazing Kenny Chan, legit my best friend ever On the internet. They helped me get this idea so thank you Kenny. I also want to say this: I know nothing about card games so I made one up. thank you

It was quiet as the game went on, All was quiet besides the sounds of water hitting wood, the shuffling of cards and the breathing of the ship inhabitants. The crew of the ship were cluttered around the wooden table, their eyes switching  from the two captains. Back and forth, Back and forth, back and forth. And the game went on. Some times the two captains would cuss when they picked up cards, sometimes smirking as they picked up the cards. They would look at their cards for a minute then put two down. Back and forth, Back and forth, back and forth.  And so the game went on, it was quiet as they played. The tension was high, The pressure heavy. Both were playing for a life, both playing for their fate. And so the game went on.

Kenny knew he had to win, If he failed not only would the merman die, no doubt die a painful death, But Kenny would have to work for Eric for the rest of his life- being a slave for the cruel pirate. If he won, on the other hand, He would get the merman, and to get the half fish that would mean he could get to the Spring of Youth, and that would mean he could become immortal!  And so the game went on, The pressure was weighing down on the blond, crushing him lower and lower. The only thing that was fueling him to win besides the thought of Being immortal was the thought of having to call Cartman ""Captain"" for the rest of his life. And that was enough to give even the toughest of Pirates nightmares. AT that moment Kenny only cared about himself, Not the merman, not his crew. But Himself. He wanted- no, he was determined to win. He wanted to become a living being that never died, He wanted to Prove he was a god, Wanted to show everyone who doubted him that they were wrong. And so the game went on, It was so much more of a game- It was destiny. Unknown to Kenny it was fate that Cartman had caught the merman, It was destiny that Kenny would play this game.


A long time ago, before Pirates began to travel across the seas, In a deep deep cave on a land long forgotten there was a tribe. This tribe were Called Jengibre, or gingers. They lived in caves and trees, They're long gone now. Hunted to their deaths. They were peaceful beings, who spoke to the gods themselves. They didn't have paper at the time so they drew their Visions on caves walls.  And so they drew, using paint they made. Long ago They had a vision and it went like this:



A pirate who was clad in orange and hair golden as the sun would find a map,one that would lead to immortality. A Pirate as cruel as death itself would catch a boy of water. The orange clad Pirate and the Cruel Pirate would cross fates on night. They would gamble On the water boy, playing for his life. Only one would win. Only one would lose. The winner got the boy and they at once traveled to the spring of youth. However There, at the place of forever life, There would have-


It was quiet as the game went on, All was quiet on the ship. Fate was being tested, Destiny was being tempted. A life for another, A chance to become Young forever. And so the game went on, This time unlike the other times... For this was a game of life Kenny put down a five, then picked up an Ace. He was sweating softly, The eyes watching him did nothing to calm The Pirate's nerves. He watched Hopelessly as Cartman Put down a five and a ten. It was clear That Kenny was playing a game already won. And so the game went on, back and forth, back and forth. Kenny wiped his forehead with his sleeve and blinked, trying to remain calm. 

""Why did you have to wager your life on a stupid fish! If You lose it's good bye to living forever and hello to washing Eric feet!''  Fear yelled, Kenny at once flinched. Cartman's crew shared a small look but Kenny didn't care. Not one bit But then logic came in and calmly said ""Relax, you already have an Ace, three, and six. All you need is another Ace. You can do this if you remain calm.'""  Kenny took a deep breath and nodded. And so he held onto Hope",candidate00004
"her. They could both Handle a level E-every vampire could basically handle a level E. They both stood up and Fula growled. ""He ruined my outfit."" She said. Kain just looked at her a little amazed. He looked at the Level E- a man who was covered-no, Soaking- in blood. His eyes were full of lust, not for sex. But for blood. ""So this is who caused this mess.."" Kain said as the Level E laughed. ""More more more!"" He sang. Kain Was disgusted at the Level E. His hands Were filled with Fire and he said ""you make me sick."" He didn't sense any one else around. Good, he didn't have to deal with Wiping Human memories. ""Ruka stand back."" He said. Ruka stood back as Kain flew some fire at the Level E,who kept dodging. Kain Growled as Ruka Decided to step in. ""Over here!"" She yelled. The monster looked at her,Then level E dove at her and Kain yelled ""No!"" He reached for Her as the Level E hands went though her. She screamed as The monster dove right though her. Kain Yelled in anger and He let loose a power he didn't know he had: he shot So much fire at the monster that at once The Level E was evaporated. Kain Fell to his knees and said ""Ruka..."" then he felt a hand on his shoulders. ""Kain-did you forget I can make illusions?"" Ruka asked. Kain looked at her and Wiped away the tears he didn't even notice he was shedding. ""Y-yeah."" He said,standing up. He smiled at Ruka right before he felt a pain in his stomach. ""Huh...?"" He said looking down, he didn't notice the blood dripping out his mouth. He didn't notice The fear in Ruka wide eyes. But what he did notice was the pair of hands jutting out of his stomach. ""Wha...?"" He asked and then collapsed. ""Kain!"" Ruka Yelled. ""I'm f-fine."" Kain said and Struggled to get up. He saw more vampires-ten at least. How did he not notice them?!! When he got up He said ""I'm...fine Ruka."" Ruka looked at him and smiled. ""Good! Your not allowed to die on me Kain! You hear that?"" She said. Kain smiled back and wiped his mouth. ""Yes...Ruka."" He said as Both of them started to fight the vampires-Kain kept taking all the hits. He didn't want Ruka to get hurt at all. Finally all the vampires were dead-long gone. ""Adios suckers"" Kain thought. ""Pardon the...pun..."" he added in his head as He slowly sunk to the ground. ""Kain?!?"" Ruka asked crouching next to him. He looked at her and Lifted a hand to her cheek. ""Your...your beautiful..."" he said. He saw Ruka was crying. ""H-hey...don't...don't cry."" He said. ""You can't die! Your fine!"" Ruka said, hitting his chest. Kain coughed and Looked into her eyes, he decided he had to do this. Using what strength he had he grabbed her and kissed her on the lips. Both of them were crying. Kain didn't get to see what happened next-his eyes closed and his breathing stopped. But before he could fully Vanish he said ""I love you Ruka..."" then everything went dark

Ruka was screaming, She was screaming so loud that People came over to see what happened. She was Holding her Knees to her chest and sobbing. She didn't even know it but She loved Kain-and know he was gone. Kain...was gone. Ruka kept crying and yelled ""go away!"" She didn't even care if she was rude.""Just get away!"" In the end Kaname had to come get her, She didn't know how he knew where she was. Some one must had called the school. It was a sad thing really...The one person she thought she loved was the one who came and got her. Not the man She really did love. Kaname Put her to sleep and Watched over her slumbering body. When she awoke She had to tell the story-had to relive what happened. During it Aido cried. Kaname did cry to. But not Ruka-she didn't want to appear weak. She didn't want pity. She didn't want any one to Pity her. At the funeral She had to deal with more crying. She slowly walked up to The coffin That would Have held Her lover and she broke down. Right there and Then. She just collapsed and she sobbed. She Hit the coffin. ""Your stupid! You could have Lived if you weren't so damn stupid!"" She screamed. Everyone looked at the Vampire who was clad in black but she didn't care. Her lover was gone. She",candidate00004
"But that doesn't mean we're not friends.""

Stein couldn't stop the answering smile that stretched across his mouth. Even weighted down by the dark thoughts that twisted through his mind like barbed wire, he couldn't fail to appreciate the rare times Spirit cast aside his outrageous behavior to reveal a far more serious nature.

Probably one of the reasons Stein had enjoyed cutting into him so much. It had become an obsession the first time he'd glimpsed the steel lurking behind warm green eyes. Stein had seen the blade that Spirit would become. Bright and sharp, slicing through flesh and stone with no hesitation, with a speed so great as to steal away any pain the blow would have brought. Merciless compassion wrapped in smiles and crying fits that had left Stein baffled even as he hungered for more.

The desire to see beneath the flesh had consumed him. Night after night he would slice into soft skin, searching, always searching for the strength that reflected the strong curve of a scythe.

Stein's eyes slid closed as the Kishin Madness seized those memories, giving them depth and substance until he could smell the copper sweetness of blood, feel Spirit's warm skin beneath his hand as he guided the scalpel. He closed his eyes but that didn't stop him from seeing the way blood gathered as the flesh yielded beneath a razor sharp point.

""Friends."" Stein's voice was rough, with desire or fear even he couldn't say. ""Yes, I do believe we are friends."" Friends did not slice through the skin in order to explore the vulnerable insides it protected. They did not feel another's strength like a siren call and hunger to explore how far it could be pressed before splintering beneath the strain.

""You haven't been the same since our fight with Medusa.""

True. The conniving little bitch had managed to sink her fangs deep before the death blow. An old adage about snakes came to mind, about how the head was still dangerous once cut away from the body. Whether it was something she did, or if it was just the Kishin Madness that had swamped the air, Stein had felt his steady slide towards insanity.

""Death has spoken to you."" Not a question. Death may have been nothing more than a white skull cloaked in shadow, but Stein had spent a lifetime reading the nuances that even shadow could not conceal.

""He is worried about you. So am I.""

""I told him that I will handle it."" Determination backed not by confidence, but by desperation. Sometimes he could almost feel clawed hands pulling him further and further into shadows edged with blood, three eyes watching him with malevolent expectation.

""I know you're slipping."" It was not laughter he saw dancing in bright green eyes, but bright light reflecting off shining steel. ""Do you think I can't feel the darkness that is eating you from the inside out?"" Spirit pressed a hand against his chest, fingers clenching in the olive green shirt he never seemed to be without.

""I have always been mad, Senpai."" Memory enhanced by madness allowed him to relive the quick spasm as relaxed muscles protested the scalpel's intrusion. Even asleep, Spirit had been so trusting.

""Not like this. You need to fight it, Stein. We can't afford to lose you.""

Stein took a quick drag on his cigarette as memory and reality merged, bringing with it the copper tang of spilled blood. ""You assume fighting would change anything."" Something chuckled, twisted darkness that gleamed with a three-eyed gaze the color of old blood. Memories twisted by madness pressed against the back of his eyes; harsh lights illuminating pale flesh, skin parting beneath the razor edge of his scalpel. ""Maybe I'm already lost.""

""Don't say that, Stein!""

Stein's eyes burned in his sockets, his joints stiff as he surged to his feet. His lips stretched into a macabre smile, the skin tight as it struggled to conform to the unnatural position. ""Truth is pain, Spirit. I take delight in both.""

Spirit didn't move as Stein stalked towards him. A fool that clung to hope even as it frayed between his fingers. Stein didn't stop until their bodies were flush, and the desire to touch lifted his hands. At one point he would have checked the impulse, but now all was shattered needs and melted rainbows out of the corner of his eye.

""I never found it you know."" Stein pressed a hand against Spirit's heart, felt the strong rhythm that never faltered. Such strength, steel hidden in a sheath of flesh and blood.

""Found what?"" Spirit's voice had faded to a dull whisper, eyes wide. Still no fear, but now there was wariness.

""I never found what made you strong.""

Wariness faded, replaced with solemn warmth that fought to banish the icy touch of madness. ""There are some things you can't dissect, Stein.""

""Maybe I just didn't look in the right place.""

Exasperated amusement rather",candidate00005
"Zevran is surprised when he wakes up to the tight, course burn of rope around his wrists, a sharp ache throbbing in the back of his skull. He thinks he was hit with a sword pommel but isn't sure, remembers fighting, the sudden drop in his stomach with the realization that the Warden would not be so easily taken. Then darkness in the wake of pain as it knifed into the back of his skull.

It's not the rope that surprises him. This is hardly the first, nor even the tenth time he can remember waking up in such a state. Neither is it the notion he was hit over the head. Again, that has happened far too often. No, he thinks as he draws in a ragged breath, squinting up at the Warden looming over him, his companions fainter shadows behind him. He is rather surprised he woke up at all.

He can see the Warden's surprise when he introduces himself, then proceeds to lay out all the information he can offer; who hired him, where he came from, what his intent had been. Although that last one is a bit obvious, it can't hurt to spell it all out. It isn't as if he has anything to lose by this point. He is a dead man walking, or rather, lying down; was the moment he failed to kill the Warden.

Zevran tells the Warden everything and then waits for the sword to fall, knowing that this time he will feel the blade, and there will be no waking up. He is at peace with that, knew the outcome when he first agreed to kill the Warden.

The Warden's appearance surprises him however, dark hair and light eyes, his face framed by sweeps of faded ink that slice across his cheek bones and sweep down to disappear beneath the line of his jaw. He is quiet, the Warden, listening and asking questions without the outrage that Zevran expected. Attempted assassinations are hardly pleasant and while there is anger there, it is banked behind the man's cool gaze, contained in sardonic questions and the tight grip of his hand on the hilt of his sword.

It is the Warden's control and whatever quirk that led him to preserve the life of his potential assassin that prompts Zevran to make his offer. Part of it is reflex, a conditioned response against overwhelming odds to ensure survival. The rest, he wishes he knew, curiosity maybe. He lets his tongue work its magic for what might be the last time and waits to see what this mysterious Warden will do next.

He blinks when the Warden accepts his offer, gathers his wits enough to cover his sudden intake of breath with a wide smile. When the rope is cut and a hand offered, it occurs to him that where there is an ending there are also beginnings, and death comes in many forms.

"between Will and Jane.  He’d seemed genuinely surprised, as if he couldn’t understand what was happening.  Luckily he hadn’t asked Will for an explanation, which was just as well since Will didn’t think he could find the words without offending him.

To put it simply, Benji was far too trusting for this line of work.

Will started slow.  He dragged the edge of his fingernail along the collar of Benji’s t-shirt.  Benji responded by absently reaching up to scratch at the back of his neck, mumbling nonsense under his breath.  Will waited a full minute before repeating the motion, muffling his laughter even though Benji wouldn’t be able to hear him through the headphones.

When Benji still didn’t catch on after the third time, Will decided to step things up.  Taking a step back he bent down so he could blow gently on the back of Benji’s neck.

“What the--?”  This time Benji twisted around, his whole body starting when he spotted Will.  With a huff he pushed the headphones back so they slid down and settled around his neck.  “How long have you been there?”

“You’ll never know,” Will said with a smirk.  He turned towards the fridge now that the game was up, asking over his shoulder, “Do you want anything?”

“No, I’m good.  Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”  Benji twisted in his chair so he could keep Will in sight.  The light from the lap top screen highlighted the dark circles around his eyes, the lines around his mouth.

“I couldn’t sleep.”  Will grabbed a bottle of water, hesitated, then grabbed a second one.  He nudged the fridge door closed with his elbow before returning to the table.  He set one bottle down next to Benji before twisting the cap off his and taking a long drink.  Rather than sit he leaned against the table, one hand gripping the edge while the other held the bottle.  He dipped his head towards the laptop.  “I could ask you the same question.  Do you think you should be doing this right now?”

“I was too wired to sleep so I figured I would take another look at the virus we grabbed.  Do you realize how close this guy came to bringing down the economic system of this country?”  Benji sagged back in his chair, eyes bright with anger. “He could have beggared everyone and all because he--”

Setting his water bottle aside, Will pushed away from the table and stepped in close, his hands resting on Benji’s shoulders.  He worked his fingers into the tight muscles as he spoke, voice soft.  “We got him, Benji.  We stopped him, and now he’s going to spend the rest of his life in some eight by ten cell, where his only human interaction is the food that gets shoved through a slot in the door.”

Benji’s head fell back until it rested against Will’s stomach.  “Yeah, I know.  It was just…,” he sighed, “it was too close.”

Will remembered the sight of Benji hunched over his lap top, sweat spotting his temple and his fingers moving in a blur as he did everything in his power to stop the virus in its tracks.  In the end it hadn’t come down to bullets or bombs, but the final stroke of the ‘Enter’ key with seconds to spare.  He’d known Benji would pull through.

“This isn’t our first near-miss, Benji.  It certainly won’t be our last.  It’s inevitable that one day we’re going to fail, so you should focus on our successes.”  Will was lucky in that he got the lesson without the consequences.  He never forgot that if it weren’t for Ethan he would have an innocent on his conscience.  He’d managed to avoid that so far, and he hoped it lasted.

Benji rubbed his face.  “I know you’re right, but that doesn’t seem to help very much.”

“Give it time.”  Will loosened his grip on Benji’s shoulders, fingers skimming over the thin t-shirt.  “As for right now, I think you should come to bed.”  He dragged his thumbs down the back of Benji’s neck.

His ministrations earned a low groan.  “I want to, I mean really really want to, but I have to get this finished or Brassel will find an excuse to dump me back into being a technician.”

“You’re dedication is commendable.”  Will leaned over and slowly pushed the laptop closed.  “But I’m going to have to insist.”

“Will, I have to finish this!”  Benji tried to sound firm, but Will could feel his resolve breaking.  It might have had something to do with the hand sliding down the front of his shirt.

“I won’t be able to sleep unless I can feel you next to me.”  Will’s admission was quiet, hanging in the air between them.  What they had was still new, a bond that",candidate00005
", not when she knew what was waiting for her in her dreams.

Looking back, she supposed that she should have known better than to think it was over. After all she had endured in her journey through the Labyrinth, she should have been suspicious.

She didn't understand why she hadn't seen it. Had she really been so naïve? She had made her way through the Labyrinth, had been locked in the oubliette, had nearly had her head pulled from her shoulders, had had to rip her way out of a dream, something that still haunted her. And all it had taken to get Toby was to deny the Goblin King with words?

In that crucial moment, she had forgotten that this story was no fairytale come to life. It was something so much more fantastic, something that held the terrible, knife edge of reality. And like knives, it cut both ways.

Sarah closed her eyes, wanting to cry as she remembered how simple the world had been back then. She had been the heroine, the one to save her baby brother and vanquish the evil Goblin King. But she hadn't understood, not like she did now.

She should have seen. She had never stopped to consider why Hoggle would be so frightened of Jareth, what had caused her friend to betray her. It had never occurred to her what it would take for a man like Jareth to be King of the Goblins. The goblins had been fierce, nasty creatures, and she had never once stopped to consider what that meant about their king. The one to rule them.

It was a week after her journey through the Labyrinth that she knew Jareth had been playing with her. The truth had left her cold and shaking in her dreams, Jareth's laughter as bold as a pair of hands skimming over her sides. He had then served to enlighten her. Everything she'd done, the words of 'power' that she had spoken had been nothing but a game to him. A game that he had allowed her to win.

He had played her game, and now she was expected to play his. Only this time it wasn't her brother that was at stake, it was Sarah herself.

Sarah closed her lips against the sob that lingered in the back of her throat, her eyes burning from lack of sleep. She was so tired, but she wouldn't, couldn't sleep. Not when Jareth was waiting for her where reality ended and dreams began.

This fight was nothing like the last. Before she had been fighting for her brother, had been filled with a sense of purpose and knowing. The goal had been clear, and the consequences unbearable. The battle she now endured had none of the certainty, and she found herself up against a foe that was far more dangerous than anything the Labyrinth could throw at her. Jareth alone had been daunting, and faced with her own desires as well, her defenses were crumbling. It was so much easier to persevere against an outside force, to push back. Caught up in the battle against her self as much as Jareth, Sarah was floundering.

Jareth's game was complex, with rules that she could never hope to understand or learn. He came with sly smiles and gleaming crystal gifts, and magic lingered in the air after he left. There was something in his eyes, something dark that repelled her, even as it drew her in. She was a fly caught in his spider's web, only the web was made of finest crystal, and his game for her was not the simple one of prey and predator.


""Sarah, beware. I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel.""


His words from that fateful confrontation continued to haunt her, echoing through her mind with newfound clarity. She would be honest with herself and say that he had warned her, couching it in abstract words and hidden meaning. In his own way, he had offered her a way out. Allow him this win, and she would escape the second, deeper game he was planning. She hadn't understood, and even if she had, her brother would always be too high of a price to pay. Not even her dreams were worth her brother's life as a human.

""You have no power over me.""

Her whisper fell flat in the darkness, nearly swallowed by the storm that continued to rage just outside. What had happened, when had everything changed? Why had she been able to defy him? Jareth twisted his words, and proclaimed that he had allowed her to win, but she had remembered the frustration in his eyes as she said those words. If nothing else had been real, she believed for that one moment, he truly had no power over her.

""What changed?"" Her voice was thin. Exhaustion was creeping up on her, sinking tempting fingers of oblivion into her tired mind.

You are no longer a child, my dear. His voice flitted through her mind, reaching her as she dangled on the cusp of sleep. Now you are something more.

"Erica is sprawled on the bed, using her mouth to investigate the soft skin covering Boyd's hip, dragging her tongue across the sharp point of bone with relish, when she hears the bathroom door open behind her.

""About time,"" she murmurs, rolling her eyes up to see Boyd's expression as he gets first glimpse, and the sharp flash of interest she sees raises the anticipation another notch, heat gathering between her legs until she can feel the wet heat building between her thighs. ""I didn't think you were going to come out at all.""

She takes her time rolling over, wants this moment to last, the quick, deep thrum of Boyd's heartbeat singing in her ears, the lighter, faster thrum of Isaac's pulse as he waits for her. Her first glimpse of Isaac takes her breath away, and she lets her eyes slowly travel down the dark tank top and the sheen of sweat on his shoulders and neck, the barely there stretch of fabric that can barely contain his erect cock, and last of all the fish net thigh highs that do absolutely wonderful things to his legs and all sorts of filthy things to her imagination.

There's a spike of lust in the room that smells like all three of them and she lets her mouth fall open so she can taste it, lets it heat her from the inside out and make her nipples contract in something that feels like it could almost be pain. She slides off the bed and onto the floor in one graceful step, her hair falling against her naked back in a caress.

""So you like it, huh?"" Isaac swallows, muscles contracting along the length of his throat, before smiling. ""I figured you would.""

""You can say that again,"" Erica breathes before she's in Isaac's space, fisting a hand into his hair and pulling him into a kiss that has no room for anything gentle. Not when she can feel the burn behind her eyes and the barely there press of fangs against her lips that means her wolf is close to the surface. She wants to shove him down and ride him, to feel the faint scratch of the fishnets on her ass, his low whines as Boyd keeps his mouth occupied.

There's a low rumble from the bed and Erica pulls back with a huff, slides a look over her shoulder. Boyd just looks at her and she rolls her eyes before using her grip in Isaac's hair to guide him towards the bed. She likes the way Boyd makes Isaac moan, so she can stand to share.

Boyd pulls Isaac onto the bed, slips a finger into the waistband of Isaac's panties and pulls that little bit so his cock can spring free. She hadn't thought the situation could get any hotter but the sight of Isaac's cock jutting out of his panties with the fishnets pressing white lines into his thighs makes her so wet she can't quite stifle the needy little moan that builds in the back of her throat.

She isn't really sure how it happens, only that she's moving forward and Boyd has turned Isaac around, so she can see his large eyes and kiss swollen mouth, his cock curling against his belly without the panties to hold it down. She pushes the panties down to his knees, holds the fish nets in place where the elastic keeps it secure, the thin lines scratching at her palms as she leans into to lick at the head of his cock.

Beneath Isaac's moan she hears the faint pop of the lube and grips at Isaacs thighs hard enough to get the chance to admire the bruises beneath the fish nets before they fade. She doesn't wait for Boyd. Not with their combined arousal making the air taste of spices on the back of her tongue. She seals her mouth over the head of Isaac's cock and then down, tilts her head so she can swallow around him. She knows when Boyd gets a finger inside, Isaac's low moan ratcheting up into keening desperation that has him gripping her hair tight enough to hurt.

Erica hums, fingers pressing hard against the fishnets. She lets Isaac start thrusting and each scrape against her fingers goes straight to her clit. She wants to press into that slick heat with her fingers, but forces her hands to stay on Isaac's thighs as he fucks her throat.

She'll get her turn.",candidate00005
"Nothing was the same.

Hands clenched at her sides, Sarah turned in a slow circle. Everything looked the same. She had been coming to this park for as long as she could remember. Nothing had changed, and yet everything was different.

Sarah couldn't pinpoint it at first. It was a subtle feeling, more an implied sensation of 'wrongness'. Looking around, there were no glaring declarations of change. The bench Merlin had sat on that afternoon so long ago was still there. The trees were just beginning to shed their leaves, following the silent prompting of fall. Out of the corner of her eye she could see joggers and bikers make their way across the small bridge spanning the lake that was the park's life blood.

Feeling lost and out of touch, she gingerly seated herself on the stone bench. The chill that clung to the pale stone seeped through her jeans, and she shivered, drawing her arms around her middle. It was unnerving how alien this place seemed. It was as if her time Underground had irrevocably changed how she viewed the Aboveground.

Sarah's breath caught in her throat as she realized just how she had referred to her world. Only it wasn't her world anymore. Now it was one of two worlds, and the Aboveground could not begin to match the depth of its twin. Ensnared by the comparison of the two, Sarah's mind brought up the image of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They were one in the same, only with two very different faces that were bound by magic. One was the monster, only Sarah couldn't decide which of the two worlds held the heart of darkness.

The grass, where before it had been lush and vivid, was now dull and brittle beneath her feet. The sky was bland; the blue was faded and worn by the passage of time and life it self. The orange and yellow leaves were rotting at the base of their parent trees, the musky scent overwhelming the flowers that struggled nearby.

When compared to the warm wind of Underground, the sharp, biting cold of Aboveground was unbearable. The air from Underground filled her lungs and tingled with every breath. She saw clearer down there, the sounds were sharper, and the tastes more intense. The lush taste of a peach still danced across her tongue, there and gone with every breath. The cold wind of Aboveground reminded Sarah more of the cold touch of metal at the nape of her neck.

The Underground had revealed to her the pitfalls of dreams gone rogue and horrible wishes whispered in a dark room. It had turned stable reality into a pitfall of treachery and leering shadows. It had done all this, and it was the World Above that left her trembling and fearful.

The deep rolling chimes of a clock reached her, and she started, her mind flashing back to a clock that bore thirteen numbers instead of twelve. She looked to the distant clock tower where her gaze was drawn to the elegant hands that marked the time. She had never stopped to consider the clock tower before. That it looked strange without the number thirteen reigning high over the other numbers was just another sign of how much things had changed.

How Jareth would laugh if he saw her now. She may have managed to deny him in the end with her words, but Sarah realized that in the end he had won. She got her brother, but he had stolen her whole world.

Shivering from an abrupt gust of icy wind, Sarah curled in on her self and closed her eyes, her forehead pressed against her knees. Her long hair fell around her legs as she saw not the drab world that was her sanctuary turned prison, but the sparkling world of magic and fire orange skies that was her nightmare turned fantasy.

"head tilted to the side as if pondering a mystery.  “You went somewhere else.  I brought you back.”

     “Is there a reason you’re in here?” Ed asks, voice sharp with fear and regret that he refuses to acknowledge.  He will see his brother again.  He will get Al’s body back and he will save his country.  There is no other option.

     “Not really.  I was bored.”  Instead of moving away Greed leans against the desk where Ed’s feet had been.  “Do you really think your friend can over power me?”

     “He’s done it before.  He can do it again.”

     Greed’s eyes narrow.  “I was caught off guard.  It won’t happen again.”

     “So you say,” Ed scoffs.  “But we both know that’s not true.  Ling won’t ever give up, not when he knows his clan is counting on him.  He cares about his people too much to do anything but keep fighting.”

     “Caring will only get a person so far,” Greed murmurs.  He smiles, eyes moving inward as he stares over Ed’s head.  “I will admit I am rather fond of him, though.  He may be annoying, but he’s almost as greedy as I am.”  When Greed’s smile widens Ed knows he’s not going to like what’s coming.  “I can see his desires, you know.  All his little dreams spread out before me.  Some aren’t very imaginative, such boring little things that only a human could want, but others…”  Fangs flash in the heart of his smile, the sheer alien delight making Ed shiver in spite of himself.  “He hungers for power, wants to wrap him self around it until there is no beginning and no end.  It’s breath-taking really.”

     Ed swallows hard, can’t, won’t listen to this.  “Go bother someone else, Greed.”  He hopes using the Homunculus’ name will encourage him to listen, but Ed isn’t really surprised when he’s ignored.

     “But I haven’t even gotten to the good part.”  It happens fast.  One moment Greed is sitting on the edge of the desk, the next he’s gone and Ed’s chair is slammed forward.  Ed gasps as he’s crushed against the edge of the desk, the sound feeble as the breath is knocked out of him.  When he tries to shove back his wrists are pinned across the surface of his desk, books and notes sliding off as Ed struggles.  Ed knows he isn’t going anywhere since he can’t use alchemy and his legs are trapped beneath the heavy desk but impossible odds have never stopped him before.

     “What are you up to, Greed?”  Ed asks, determined to remain calm.  He knows, or thinks he knows, that Greed won’t hurt him.  Not after Ed had already agreed to work for him. 

     “Such a greedy thing, our friend Ling.  So strong, so noble.”  Greed’s breath feathers hot against Ed’s cheek, soft bangs brushing against his ear.  “Would you like to know what he dreams about?”

     “I already know what he dreams about,” Ed bites out.  His hands are clenched into fists and he can’t help that, not when every instinct is screaming and he’s trapped with no way out until Greed decides to give him one. 

     “Yes, he wants to be Emperor and he wants to bring his clan honor, those are all the things on the surface, the things he wants people to know about.”  Greed laughs.  “I’m talking about the things he won’t even admit to him self, the dreams that lurk in the back of his mind.”

     “I don’t want to know.”  Ed knows this, knows that no good will come from learning something that clearly gives Greed this much amusement.

     “Oh, I think you should, one of them concerns you after all.  Our Ling has quite the imagination I will admit.”  Greed’s hands flex around Ed’s wrists.  “He has plans for you once he becomes Emperor, Fullmetal.  He wants to take you home with him, wants to cover you in jewels and silk and show you off like the gem you are.  He wants to fuck you, Alchemist, wants to keep you as a prize.”  Greed’s chuckle skims over Ed’s shoulders.  “I can’t say I really blame him.”

     “Stop it.”  Ed’s voice is thick, the words lodged in his throat.  His face is on fire and all he can think about is shoving Greed away and leaping over the desk for the safety of the door. 

     “Would you agree if he asked you to go home with him?  Would you let him take you back to his homeland and keep you like a prize pet?  After a life such as yours I would think it tempting.  A chance to live in the lap of luxury, and I do mean that",candidate00005
"t sound like you handled it. Do I have to come over after all?”

Charles chuckled. “Don’t worry. I was a little preoccupied, but I called Moira yesterday and she’s positive that she can find him a place to stay.”

Raven’s second eyebrow rose to join the first. “You’re finding him another apartment? That’s your plan?”

“Well, technically Moira--”

“What happend to changing the locks?”

“That would hardly help. Erik is a mutant. He can--”

Raven frowned. “Wait, what? He’s a mutant? You didn’t say he was a mutant!”

“It doesn’t really make a difference, does it?”

Apparently it did for Raven, because her whole demeanour changed all of a sudden. “What kind of mutation?” she asked curiously, leaning forwards and slurping on her drink.

“Electromagnetism. He can manipulate metal and… what?”

Raven stared at him wide-eyed, her mouth hanging open. “Manipulate metal? Erik… not… not Erik Lehnsherr, surely?”

Charles gave her a questioning look. “That’s his name, ye--”

“Oh my god!” Raven shrieked, her hands flailing around and her mind a buzz of excitement. “You’re intruder is Magneto!?”

“Who?”

“Oh god, you really live under a rock. Magneto! He’s the leader of the Brotherhood!”

“Leader? I knew he was involved with them but--”

“God, Charles, he’s amazing! Mutant and proud!”

And then Charles got a mental picture of Magneto, seen through his sister’s eyes. And sure as hell, it was Erik. But he was… Magneto seemed like a good name. He had the radiance of a revolutionary leader, standing on a pile of wooden pallets with a megaphone in his hand. His shirt was riding up under his worn leather-jacket, his hair stood askew and there was a manic glint in his eyes as he shouted to the crowd. Someone else might have looked silly, Erik looked mesmerizing and, yes, magnetic.

Then something else occured to Charles. “How do you… did you go to one of their rallies?”

Raven suddenly looked like a deer caught in the headlights. “Just maybe one or two… okay, four. And a few of the meetings of the local group at my university.”

“What?” Charles reached out and grabbed her hand across the table, cold dread filling his chest. “What if someone finds out--”

“Yes,” Raven returned sharply. “That’s rather the point, isn’t it? It’s his point, anyway. That we shouldn’t have to hide who we are!”

The skin of her hand rippled under his palm, and Charles gripped her tighter in alarm.

“That’s easy for him to say, when he can pass for human any day!”

He was going to kill Erik for putting such ideas in his sister’s head.

“But that’s it!” Raven objected defensively. “He’s completely open about being a mutant. And he’s proud of it!”

Charles didn’t know how he could talk sense into her. “Raven, once your secret is out, you might not be able to take it back,” he pleaded.

“You could.”

Charles closed his eyes. “And you know I would do almost anything to protect you. But please, Raven, don’t put me in that position.”

“Erik says we shouldn’t restrict ourselves just because the humans are scared of us,” Raven told him, her chin set in a fierce line.

“Dear god,” Charles muttered. “Erik is currently using his mutation to break into my home. What happened to calling the police on him and throwing him out?”

“I didn’t know you were talking about Erik Lehnsherr when I said that! Who’d want to throw him out, that man is sex on a stick! He can break into my place anyti--”

“Raven!”

“What?”

“I thought you and Hank...”

“Yeah, well, a girl can dream.” Raven shrugged. “It’s not like he’d be interested in me.”

“Can we please stop talking about this?”

Somehow the idea of Erik and Raven made Charles stomach feel like lead. He ordered another glass of wine and drank half of it in one go. When he came home he would talk to Erik. Their situation was becoming ridiculous and had to end, nevermind how hot and amazing his sister thought Erik was.

 

 

“You!” Charles barked when he came home two hours and a bottle of wine later. “You seduced my sister!”

“Pardon?” Erik had come out from the kitchen, drying his hands on a dish towel with a frown marring his face. “No offense, I’m sure your sister is lovely, but I can assure you the only one I’ve been trying to seduce has been you.”

“That’s--” Charles broke off,",candidate00006
"off, turning his head and brushing a kiss against the corner of Erik's mouth. “I know you want me,” he breathes. “And I want you, too.”

Erik is helpless, utterly helpless. He stands no chance when Charles’ lips press against his, can’t remember why he should be resisting when Charles’ tongue teases his mouth open. With a groan, Erik grabs him, one hand on his jaw and one on his hip, pulling him closer and diving in deeper, biting at his too red lips and sucking on his tongue. It’s messy and perfect and Charles lets him, rocking his hips forwards and rubbing his stiff cock into the crease of Erik’s thigh.

It's glorious, having Charles in his arms, and maybe Erik is going a little mad. His own cock is throbbing in his tight jeans, all his blood rushing south and leaving his head completely empty. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, he just knows he wants more of it, more of Charles, needs it like oxygen.

“Come up to my room with me,” Charles whispers against his ear, and Erik just nods stupidly.

He’s forgotten about his bike, about the essay he should be writing tonight, about how he doesn’t really know Charles beyond the fact that he sleeps with men for money. He lets Charles take him by the hand, pulled along by the brightness of his smile and the swagger in his hips. Charles is like a force of nature and Erik is only human.

When they stands next to each other in the elevator, and Erik watches the automatic doors close in front of them, reality comes rushing back. He glances sideways and sees Charles gnaw at his lip. For a second, there's a crack in the confident demeanor. An unexpected glimpse of what might be lying under all of Charles' bluster, and a reminder that Charles is a person, a guy Erik's age, not just a fantasy. It makes Erik feel awkward. He wants to say something, but he has no idea what would be appropriate and before he can come up with anything, the elevator stops. Charles steps out and shoots him a wicked smile over his shoulder.

Erik can see it now. How Charles' whole appearance and mannerisms are designed, a mask he dons, and Erik tells himself that this isn't what he wants. But he still follows Charles, down the corridor to a plain door and further into a nondescript room. It's impersonal. The perfect place for anonymous sex with a prostitute, and Erik can't stand it. He doesn't want to think of Charles that way. Doesn't want to be like one of these men Charles brings here to let them fuck him.

Charles must sense his sudden hesitancy because, once the door has fallen shut behind them, he turns to Erik with a challenging glint in his eyes.

“Something wrong?” he asks loftily, raising his eyebrows.

Erik nervously clears his throat. “No. It’s just… We don’t have to.” He gestures between them. “You know?”

“Don’t tell me you've got scruples?”

Erik shuffles his feet, but apparently Charles will have none of it. Falling into a seductive pose with practiced ease, he shrugs off his jacket and then grabs the bottom of his red turtleneck, slowly pulling it up and over his head. Even if he wanted to, Erik can't turn away. The view of Charles’ chest and stomach is even more entrancing at close quarters. His nipples are a dusky pink, and a sparse trail of hair is running from his navel down into the waistband of his jeans. There's a half moon scar over his left hipbone, which feels oddly intimate, and Erik catches himself with the silly urge to run his fingertips along the raised skin, pressing kisses to Charles' shoulder while he tells the story behind it.

“You like what you see, don’t you?” Charles pulls him back into reality. There's a knowing look in his eyes and his smile is taunting. “I know you do.”

He pops the buttons of his jeans, and lets them hang open, precariously clinging to his hips. From what Erik can tell, he's not wearing any underwear.

“I know all the filthy things you want to do to me.” Charles' voice turns low and he slowly stalks closer, alluring and just a little dangerous. As far as seduction goes, he is obviously a professional. “You want to pin me down and make me beg for you to fuck me. Want to suck my cock and taste that dark, secret place you can’t help thinking of, even though you’ve never done anything like that before.” He glances up at Erik through his long lashes before he whispers, “Don’t worry, I can teach you all the things you’ve only ever dreamed of.”

Erik stands stock-still, breathing shallowly through his mouth.

"bugging him. He even seemed to have the surprising ability to know when Arthur would indulge his idle chatter and when to fade into the background while still providing company. Today Arthur enjoyed the latter.

He had been thinking about his decision for the better part of the evening already, and he knew it was the right choice. Still, he was hesitating, indulging himself with a few more moments of what would soon become his old life. Because from here on out, everything would change.

He had decided to tell his uncle first. It was a courtesy, and it would keep Arthur from backing out. He knew the man wouldn't agree with his choice, but Arthur had come to understand that his uncle's advice was far from infallible.

Agravaine's reaction, then, was as Arthur had predicted. He tried to sway him, reminding him of his duty, going so far as claiming that he could provide all the support that Arthur needed. What his uncle couldn't know was that Arthur had thought of his duty first when making this decision. He needed a queen. Camelot needed a queen. At some point there had to be an heir. If there wasn't, it would only further the ambitions of their enemies.

And Gwen would be a good queen. She knew the hearts of Camelot's people, could provide Arthur with a more empathetic understanding that his upbringing had not granted him. She would be honest with him and supportive and, most importantly, Gwen was loyal. Gwen would never betray him, never stab him in the back like Morgana had done, never withhold the truth like his father. It might not be the love of fairy tales, but then Arthur had never expected his marriage to be. He would be fortunate to marry someone for whom he felt affection and respect. It was more than he had ever hoped for.

So, while he wasn't surprised by his uncle's comments, the reaction that slightly threw him, was Merlin's.

''I'm going to marry Guinevere,'' he'd said, and Merlin had dropped what he was holding with an enormous clatter.

Arthur's intentions towards Gwen weren't something he had never spoken of before, so Merlin had hardly a reason to be so surprised. He would have blamed Merlin's general clumsiness, had his manservant not frozen in place for the longest time before bending down to pick up the bowl he'd been polishing. And even then Merlin did not turn around but remained where he was, his shoulders hunched, his head bowed over his work.

It wouldn't have been so disconcerting, had it been anyone else but nosy, inappropriate Merlin, and it distracted Arthur so much, that he skipped most of his carefully prepared speech, ending up being rather curt with Agravaine.

He couldn't even summon enough care to feel regret about alienating his uncle, when Merlin had not looked at him once since he voiced his plans for marriage. The door closed behind an obviously ruffled Agravaine, leaving a tense and awkward silence in his wake.

Arthur picked up his goblet of wine which he had abandoned on the table earlier, taking a deep gulp.

''You're not saying anything,'' he observed after a few more moments had passed.

Merlin flinched a little.

''What would you have me say, sire?''

''It's not like I can ever get you to shut up about my personal business otherwise.''

Merlin turned around then, finally, a bright smile on his face.

''Just trying to comply with your wishes, sire,'' he said, trying for cheerful.

Arthur raised an eyebrow, granting Merlin with a dubious look.

''I'm... sure Gwen will be ecstatic?''

Arthur just kept looking while Merlin fidgeted, the smile fading from his face.

''And... I know that you...'' Merlin began, but faltered.

He looked away and took a deep breath, like he had to compose himself. But when he met Arthur's eyes again, his smile was back. It was smaller, but also more real. Private.

''You know I wish you all the happiness there is, Arthur. And I'm glad... I'm glad you are following your heart.''

Arthur could only stare at Merlin, watch as the fire from the hearth planted flickering shadows on his pale face. His heart. It was strange that it took Merlin saying those words for Arthur to realize who in fact was in possession of this sorry but tenacious thing.

''Gwen will... She will be a good queen. For Camelot,'' Arthur said with some difficulty.

And it was still true. Even if his epiphany would have been of any consequence, even if there would have been such a possibility as being not alone in his insanity, and there wasn't,... it still would not have changed a thing.

He was the king. His duty was and always would be to Camelot.

''I'm sure she will be wonderful.''

''Yes.''

''I just... I guess, I was a bit surprised...'' Merlin bowed his head",candidate00006
"all his life.

~*~

When the sun is standing high above them, warming their skin to the point of sweating, they decide to go for a swim, anchoring the Avalon in a hidden nook of a bay. It has calmer waters and steep cliffs that shelter them from the wind as well as keep anyone but the most adventurous strollers from approaching its beach.

Arthur pulls his shirt over his head, toes off his shoes and starts to wriggle out of his trousers when he catches Merlin looking. He seems to be staring at Arthur's chest and the tips of his ears are bright red again. Arthur grins. If there's one thing he feels confident about, it's his body; he's strong with lean muscles form work and sailing, tanned from being out on the water every day. So he gives Merlin a challenging look, raising his eyebrows with a hint of mocking, as if to say 'see something you like?'.

Merlin blinks, almost taken aback, and then blushes even brighter.

Arthur chuckles. ''What's up, Merlin? Aren't you going to get out of your clothes? Don't tell me you're shy.''

Merlin glares at him, but then stands up, feet planted securely apart, and starts to unbutton his shirt, all the while looking at Arthur with the same challenge in his eyes. It's Arthur turn to blush a little. Merlin is leaner than Arthur but still well-muscled. His shoulders are broad and his stomach is flat and there's more hair on his chest than Arthur would have thought, but somehow it's an intriguing contrast with Merlin's pale skin. His long limbs make him look graceful – at least until he starts trying to get out of his trousers and nearly falls over board in the process.

Arthur catches him just in time, his fingers wrapping around Merlin's forearm, and once more Merlin catches his balance by holding on to Arthur. Only this time Merlin's hand presses against the naked skin of Arthur's chest and all Arthur can think is that Merlin must surely feel how quickly his heart is beating.

''Wow Merlin, really smooth. Were you born this clumsy or do you work at it?'' Arthur asks, and then winces when Merlin stares at him wide-eyed. This probably sounded far more rude than he intended to.

''I'm sorry,'' Arthur says, smiling sheepishly. ''I-...''

''Become a prat whenever there might be something like a pesky emotion on the horizon?''

Arthur blinks.

Merlin grins.

Arthur cocks his head and narrows his eyes.

Merlin raises his eyebrows, looking innocent.

Arthur shakes his head, takes a step back and shoves Merlin over board.

Merlin makes a squeaking sound and then hits the water with a splash. He breaks the surface a moment later, spluttering and scowling up at a grinning Arthur while wiping water from his eyes.

''You're a dollop head!'' Merlin accuses, and Arthur throws his head back and laughs.

''What does that even mean?'' he asks, still grinning, and then sits down, swinging his legs over the side, and slides into the water with a lot more grace and a lot less splashing than Merlin.

Merlin's look turns fond then. ''It means: Arthur Pendragon in all his prattish glory. I invented it just for you.''

''Oh wow, Merlin, I feel so special now,'' Arthur drawls. ''Maybe I need to come up with a personal insult for you as well then?''

Merlin shakes his head. ''Nah... you can just call me an 'idiot' or maybe a 'buffoon'. I'm not that special.''

Arthur laughs. ''I don't believe that for a second. But since you obviously have a severe mental affliction, 'idiot' does seem fitting.''

Merlin nods happily, and Arthur shakes his head and dunks him under water. The fight is on then, and while Arthur is certainly the stronger one of them, Merlin is incredibly sneaky and sometimes shows up where Arthur least expects him to.

Finally, when they are completely exhausted from their shenanigans, they swim back to the Avalon and hold on to the hull, panting and grinning at each other like little boys. Arthur shakes his wet hair out of his eyes, showering Merlin with droplets of water.

Suddenly there's a hand on Arthur's neck and he is dragged forward. His first thought is that Merlin is going to dunk him again but that doesn't happen. Instead Merlin presses his lips against Arthur's, wet and a little cold, and then suddenly warm when he opens his mouth and takes advantage of Arthur's surprised gasp to deepen the kiss.

It's incredible and intoxicating and Arthur wraps his free arm around Merlin's shoulders to pull him closer against his chest. Merlin makes a keening sound, hand tightening in Arthur's hair like he's drowning.

Then he suddenly pulls back and turns his head away, but not before Arthur gets a glimps at his distraught expression.

''Oh god, I",candidate00006
"blond girl. As far as he can tell, Lady Vivian is a spoiled brat without much of an independent thought in her head. “What can I do for you?”

“My friends and I want to go for a ride,” she says curtly. “I want you to saddle up Buttercup and two other horses—“

“How about this one?” A dark haired girl comes up behind Vivian, painted lips curling into an uppity smile. Her eyes travel up and down Arthur's body with obvious appreciation. “He looks strong. I certainly would enjoy taking him through his paces.”

Arthur's face remains expressionless. “Excalibur is quite temperamental,” he says, calming the horse with a gentle touch. “He needs an experienced rider.”

The girl steps closer and puts a hand on Arthur's chest, stroking over the fabric of his shirt. “Don't worry. I know how to handle a rough ride.”

Arthur forces himself to stand still and not react. It's hardly the first time he's been propositioned. He knows these people see little more in him than a object to fit their momentary whims—much like the horses he's tending to.

“I'm afraid his Lordship's instructions—“

“I'm sure he'll find you another horse,” Vivian interjects with a glare at Arthur. “Daddy doesn't even let me ride Excalibur.”

As they walk away, her friend shoots him a salacious look over her shoulder. Luckily, Arthur has lost his ability to blush a long time ago.

Picking up the tack, he does his best to ignore the not-so-hushed whispers coming from outside, but when he steps into the bay of the first horse, he is stopped short. There's a boy standing next to the chestnut mare, petting her nose. Truthfully, he's probably not that much younger than him, but the war has aged Arthur beyond his years. The boy is staring at him like he's been caught in a crime, making Arthur wonder how long he's been in here. What he has heard.

“Vivian says you have your eyes on the stable hand,” a teasing voice can be heard just then.

“I certainly wouldn't mind taking that hunk for a ride.”

“Good Lord, he's not even a gentleman!” Vivian sounds more gleeful than scandalized.

“I know. I bet he fucks like an animal.”

The boy is blushing to the roots of his hair now, apparently innocent enough to be shocked by such words. He looks well bred, with high cheekbones and pale skin, his light summer suit pristine in a way that gives Arthur the urge to muss him up. When he silently raises his eyebrows, the boy ducks his head and quickly steps past him, stumbling over his own feet in his haste to get away. It makes Arthur smile to himself as he saddles the horses.

*

Since the day is hot, Arthur's shirt is clinging uncomfortably to his back by the end of it. He pulls it off by the trough and sticks his head under the spout, pumping the handle until water cascades over his neck and shoulders, running down his chest and trickling along his spine into the waist of his trousers. He shakes his head like a dog before picking up a rag to dry his face. That's when he catches the boy lurking from the corner of his eye.

“Something you want?” he asks, keeping his back turned.

The boy steps out of the shadows, gnawing at his lips which makes them look red and used. There's something almost sweet about him, a contrast to the determined look in his eyes.

“I'm—my name is Merlin.”

Arthur turns around. “Okay.”

“I heard what they said. Nimueh and Sophia and Viv. Before.”

Arthur raises an eyebrow, but doesn't say anything. Merlin's eyes seem caught on Arthur's chest.

“Do you... did you—? With her?”

“Does it matter?”

Merlin looks away and shrugs, and Arthur regards him contemplatively as he pulls a pack of cigarettes from his trousers. He shakes one out and sticks it between his lips before lighting it and taking a first drag.

“Do you want to know what it feels like?” he asks, leaning back against the trough.

Merlin shoots him a startled look. “No.” He swallows. “Yes.”

“Well, what is it?”

“I want to know. Just—not with a girl.”

His face is bright red now.

Arthur takes another drag, squints at him. “You want to know how it feels like between men.”

Merlin nods.

“Why do you think I'd be able to tell you?”

Merlin's eyes widen. “Oh, I—I'm sorry, I thought—” he stutters, mortification evident, and Arthur realises with a pang that this is how he must have looked like, back then. A lifetime ago.

He closes his eyes, and for a moment allows himself",candidate00006
", Valiant was waiting for him with two of his lackeys. Gilli was a new addition to the team this year, a left-back who had a tendency to slack off while over-estimating himself and had earned more than one dressing down from Arthur for it. The third boy, Cedric, wasn't even on the team and had no business at all hanging around in the changing rooms.

From the way the three formed a solid wall blocking his way, Arthur immediately had a sense of foreboding. There was a tension in the air, a confrontation looming that had the potential to get ugly. Arthur knew that, while he might be able to take on Valiant, he would definitely have the disadvantage if he had to go up against all three of them. The fact that he was naked apart from a towel loosely slung around his hips, while the others were fully dressed, only helped to emphasise his vulnerability.

''Have you been waiting for me? Or what are you still doing here?'' Arthur asked, trying to sound casual.

''Yeah,'' Valiant said with a mean glint in his eyes. ''I wanted to talk to you.''

Arthur raised his eyebrows. ''All right, let me get dressed and I'll meet you outside.''

''We want to talk now.''

Taking a deep breath, Arthur crossed his arms over his chest and subtly widened his stance. ''What's so important, then, that it can't wait a few more minutes?''

Valiant narrowed his eyes. ''What? Not going to get dressed, Pendragon? We can talk at the same time.''

Arthur shot him an ironic look. ''I'm fine, thank you.''

This seemed to knock Valiant off his stride and he frowned for a moment before he pulled himself up again to full bluster. ''Well... We don't like your faggoty training methods,'' he spat, putting his hands on his hips and making the muscles in his arms bulk out.

''They are the same training methods we used last year, which took us all the way to the championships,'' Arthur reminded him, not raising up to the bait.

''We didn't know you're a faggot then!''

Arthur did his best to hold on to his calm. ''Me being gay doesn't change their efficiency,'' he said sharply.

Valiant sneered. ''There's too much touching involved. We don't want to be groped by a homo.''

Arthur grit his teeth. ''I haven't ever partnered with you during any of them, and I don't plan to. So what, exactly, is your problem, Val?''

Valiant took a step closer, right into Arthur's space. ''We don't like having to watch faggots pawing each other either,'' he hissed.

''We? Cedric isn't even on the team – and shouldn't be in here, by the way,'' he shot the shifty boy a glare before he turned back to Valiant, ''Why don't you come out and say it, Val? This is you having a problem with me.''

''And if it is?''

Arthur raised his chin. ''Then, unless you can come up with any professional concerns, I suggest you get over it or step down from the team.''

''Oh no, Pendragon, I'm not gonna leave the team. But you should because there's no place for faggots!''

That's when the first push came, but Arthur had been expecting it and only stumbled a little before he found his footing again. Balling his hands into fists, he raised them in front of him defensively.

As if they had only waited for this signal to attack, all three of the boys stormed at him. Gilli wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, but he had a lot of brutal strength and Cedric proved enough of an distraction to throw Arthur off his balance They scuffled, and Arthur got a few good punches in, but in the end, it was him being pinned against the wall by five hands, completely starkers after having lost his towel in the fight. Valiant glared at him with triumphant fury and gripped Arthur's hair, banging his head against the wall with so much force that Arthur vision went black for a moment.

He was too disoriented to realise what was happening when he suddenly felt a gust of wind, and then there was a series of bangs as Arthur's attackers flew backwards, crashing into the lockers and slumping to the floor with a chorus of groans and curses.

Trying to clear his vision, Arthur blinked and caught sight of Merlin standing in the doorway. The other boy's eyes were glowing golden and the air was almost crackling with energy around him. Too dumbstruck, Arthur didn't know what to say, all he could do was stare at Merlin with his heart beating wildly in his chest, pumping so much adrenalin through his veins, he felt almost high with it. Merlin stared back and, suddenly, there was a gentle, tingling touch at the corner of Arthur's mouth,",candidate00006
"'m cold. You have to warm me up.''

 

Arthur let out a strained laugh. ''Merlin. You can't... god, you really have no sense of propriety at all, do you?''

 

Merlin giggled and buried his face against Arthur's neck. ''Nooo? Because you are a prat. And I need your toes. On it, I mean.. need to keep you there, yes.''

 

''Do you now?'' Arthur asked, trapped somewhere between annoyance, amusement and - yes, damn it - arousal.

 

''Yesh. But pssssht... no one can know. Because we are coins, yeah? And if anyone would know, I couldn't stay with you. And I really, really need to stay with you, Arthur.''

 

Merlin looked up at him then, imploringly, and Arthur cleared his throat awkwardly, because Merlin's face was full of adoration.

 

''You're drunk, Merlin,'' Arthur groaned out and Merlin nodded happily.

 

''Yeah...'' he sighed, frowning a little for a moment, but then the goofy grin was back. ''But you love me anyway... yeah?''

 

Arthur looked at Merlin, flushed and pliant and somehow glowing with an inner light.

 

''Yeah,'' Arthur whispered, and then had to swallow against the sudden dryness in his throat. ''You should go to sleep now. I'll hang your clothes up by the fire.''

 

''T's so nice of you Arthur... you should be nice more... like it.''

 

Arthur lightly cuffed Merlin around the ears. Well, it was meant as a cuff, and if it ended up as more of a petting kind of caress, it really didn't matter because Merlin was already tilting to the side, burrowing his face in the pelt, and soon after there were those little puffs of breath that meant that Merlin had fallen into the oblivion of sleep. 

 

***

 

It had become cold when the sun had gone down, spring taking his sweet time this year. So Arthur wasn't really surprised when he pulled his own bedroll closer to the flames and saw that Merlin was shivering a little in his sleep. Arthur had put Merlin's wet clothes up on branches to dry beside the fire and put some more wood on the flames in the hope that it would keep the fire burning for at least a little while. 

 

When he turned back to the heap of fur and blankets that had his manservant buried beneath, Merlin had turned on his side, face to the fire. The flickering light was dancing over his features in a way that left Arthur breathless once more. His long lashes threw sooty shadows over his cheeks, his long nose seemed elegant now and those lips... Arthur really had to drag his eyes away from those lips, because the things he was thinking weren't things he should be thinking and if he didn't look away soon, they might lead to him doing things he very, very much shouldn't be doing. 

 

On the other hand, Merlin obviously was cold, and the best way to keep the chill away was sharing body heat, something Arthur and Merlin had done on many an occasion. It was totally normal for Arthur to put his own bedroll next to Merlin's so that Merlin had the fire at his front and Arthur's body at his back. There wasn't that much space because of the log, but that would be a good shelter for Arthur so it was actually perfect. 

 

Arthur quickly undressed down to his small clothes and dove into the pelts, arranging them so that they covered both him and Merlin because Arthur's were thicker and warmer and that way they could share all the heat. It was a good plan, and Merlin seemed to agree even in his sleep, because he sighed softly in what had to be contentment and wriggled around a little until his back was flush against Arthur's front. This left Arthur feeling very warm indeed.

 

The problem was, though, that Merlin wouldn't stop wriggling. The other problem was that Arthur didn't know where he should put his hands, and he realised that this had previously not been an issue because they mostly had shared body heat while lying back to back. Well there was no room for this here, so Arthur just put one arm around Merlin, hoping that might keep his manservant from shifting around so much. Only as soon as Arthur's sword calloused hand came to rest on Merlin's chest, Merlin started to snuggle back even closer to Arthur, grinding his arse into Arthur's groin with a soft little sigh. And for the love of Camelot, Arthur was a man who prided himself on his control, but this was just too much even for a knight of Camelot. He couldn't help but grind back just a little, pressing his aching cock into the cleft between Merlin's cheeks. For a second Arthur thought he would spend from that pleasure alone, and he couldn't stop himself from wriggling his other arm between them so that he could finally release his throbbing erection.

Robin sighed. She had learned that the best way to bribe Luffy was with food, preferably meat “Luffy, we can go to the any restaurant you want, my treat, if you finish the assignments flawlessly”

Luffy’s eyes lit up and he started to salivate. He quickly started on his assignments, which would probably take a while since he would make sure everything was perfect, after all there was food on the line.

Robin been helping Luffy for the last two years. She assumed that he had to do well in school since he was being forced to go. Luffy was probably her best way off this island safely, not to mention she had grown fond of him and his friends. Considering that she was about ten years older than all of them, they had accepted her as their friend almost immediately. Everyone seemed to have a bit of admiration for Luffy, although she wasn’t sure if it was his personality or something he had done for them.

After about two hours Luffy had finished all of his work. Robin had mostly read the entire time, but Luffy asked for her help every once and awhile.

“Okay, well it looks like everything's good. Do you want to go to the same place” Robin asked.

Luffy shook his head “There’s a new place, can we go there?”

“Sure, it’s on the other side of town isn’t it?”

Luffy nodded. The place was apparently supposed to be pretty good, and it was relatively cheap. Robin smiled a bit. Luffy could eat her into debt, but she got paid enough to pay for the apartment, and to buy her own food, and save a bit. She, however, could only treat him like this once maybe twice a month.

Zoro sat down at the dojo. He always went back when he had nothing to do so he could train, and help out his sensei if his sensei needed it. Since Kuina had died, Zoro was by far the best swordsman. Zoro’s brute strength and speed exceeded everyone’s, but Koshiro’s technique was still far better.

Due to Zoro’s status at the dojo, he was often challenged. At the moment he was fighting with one sword against a thirteen year old. To everyone watching it was almost sad how easy it was for Zoro. Eventually Zoro knocked the bamboo sword down to the side and tapped the kid on the head with his own sword.

The kid threw his sword on the ground in frustration. Zoro smacked him over the side of the head with his own bamboo sword “Don’t treat your sword like” he told the kid seriously. The kid nodded quickly, picking up his sword and going off to practice again.

Nami walked into the dojo and sighed “Come on Zoro, he just a kid”

“No swordsman should treat his sword like that, and shut up or I won’t help you” Zoro replied slightly annoyed, though he remembered his own experiences. The only reason she ever came to the dojo was because she screwed up when trying to steal something.

This was an easy way for Zoro to get out of debt from her. She was the only one of any of them that always had money, not to hard to figure out why, and he always borrowed from her. She also happened to charge insane amounts of interest because she was a terrible person. It ended up being a bit of a game to see who could make the other person build up more debt. It was common courtesy that they didn’t change their rates.

Luffy currently was sleeping with his head on Robin’s lap on the park bench where they had met. She was walking him home and he said he was tired, so he pulled her over to the bench and fell asleep.

Robin sighed as she ran her hand through Luffy’s hair. She had been accepted into Luffy’s group almost immediately. She actually, for the first time in a long time, felt bad that she was keeping her past a secret from someone.

“Luffy come on let’s go, it’s getting late” Robin said, lightly shaking him awake.

“But I’m tired, it’s too far” he complained.

“Come on, let’s go back to my place then”

“Fine, I guess that’s not too bad” Luffy said with a small groan.

As Robin walked Luffy to her house, they got a few smiles from some older couples. Robin was pretty sure that they thought her and Luffy were a couple. She actually didn’t mind. It was the first time that she had really started to feel like a normal person. Of course she knew what she was doing wasn’t normal, and it was generally frowned upon, but regardless, no one looking at them knew who they were or what their relationship was.

“Damn, my friends are so uncool. But their my friends so I guess that means I’m being uncool as well” Soul said to himself with a bit of a sigh.

As he came up to his and Maka’s apartment, he noticed a large box with a ribbon tied around it. It was barely thin enough to get through the door, and over half his height. Opening his door, he pushed it into the apartment. After closing his door, he looked around for a card, or any writing to indicate who left it. Turning one arm into a scythe, he cut the ribbon on the box. Slowly opening the lid, he jumped back and fell in surprise.

After a few seconds, Liz rose out of the box with a ribbon on her head.

Soul blinked a few times before laughing. “Damn, you scared the shit out of me. Honestly I thought the night was a bit lame when everyone bailed early, but you really cheered me up.”

Liz smiled. “That was the plan” she said softly.

“Man, you guys went pretty far for that joke, but I’ll let you know it was totally worth it. You guys are never gonna get me that good again.”

“Soul, it wasn’t a joke” Liz said softly. She didn’t seem to be able to raise her voice any higher, or sound any more confident.

Soul snorted “Sure, you were just gifting yourself to me. You already got me, no need to carry out the act. You guys are pretty cool after all.”

“Soul—” Liz started before being cut off.

“Come on Liz, thanks for the cheer up, but come on. You’re not a slut, if anyone would be gifting themselves to me in that why I would suspect Blair. Anyways I’m kinda tired now” Soul said, putting one hand on Liz’s back and pushing her lightly out the door. “I’ll see you tomorrow” he said with a wave, and shut the door.

Liz stood there, looking at the door, wanting to knock, but couldn’t. As tears started streaming down her cheek, she turned around and left.

As the sun rose, Soul got up. Walking out he of room, he saw Maka standing in the living room with her hands on her hips.

“Hey Maka. Didn’t think you’d be back so soon. That was—”

“MAKA CHOP!”

“Dammit. What the hell was that for?” Soul asked angrily.

“What was that for? What the hell happened last night?” Maka asked, even more angrily.

“What, the whole prank thing, it went just as you planned I suspect” Soul said, slightly confused.

“IT WASN’T A JOKE” Maka yelled.

Soul cowered in the corner, afraid of being hit again.

“If it was a joke, I wouldn’t have slept over at Tsubaki’s. Liz was having troubles confessing, so we helped come up with an idea for her.”

“Wait, Liz was having troubles confessing what?” Soul asked, already having a bit of an idea.

Maka sighed. It seemed like Soul really was clueless, which was why it must have hurt so much. “Liz likes you. She’s wanted to ask you out for a while now, but couldn’t muster up the courage. The fact that you brushed her off without even acknowledging what she was trying to do hurt her a lot. She was crying all last night. Hell she was crying this morning. It made her feel like you didn’t even consider it a possibility that she would ever be someone you would date.”

“W-what? Sh-she likes me?” Soul stuttered.

Maka facepalmed. She knew he felt the same way, which was why she assured Liz that everything would go the way they planned, but he was just too stupid. “She should still be at Tsubaki’s.”

Soul made it to Tsubaki’s in record time. Knocking on the door, he tried to catch his breath.

Tsubaki answered the door. “Are you here to make things right?”

Soul nodded.

“Ok, she’s in my room” Tsubaki said, moving out of the way.

Soul made his way to Tsubaki’s room in the back. “Liz, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize what you were trying to do. I didn’t even consider the possibility—”

“What, that you could ever date someone like me?” she asked bitterly.

Kneeling down next to her, Soul shook his head “No, I never considered the possibility that someone like you would like me.

""Come on it's my birthday,"" Zoe complained.

""Fine just make sure all your homework's done,"" Jack told her, letting his mock resistance fade away.

""Yeah yeah"" Zoe replied walking away.

"hearing a small click from under the drivers seat, Alibaba got up and opened to the top. “You ok, you were in there for quite a while, and I know it can get uncomfortable”



Morgiana nodded. The seat the she was hiding in was locked from the inside. The only way to open it was to unlock it from the bottom, and then unlock the top.



“Why are you helping me so much” Morgiana asked as she took the apple that Alibaba offered her.



“Well, it’s not like I’m doing this for free. I expect to get something from you” he told her. Morgiana’s eyes shifted down a bit. She thought as much. People rarely helped others for free, and that was doubly so when it came to slaves. “I need a traveling companion. If you wanna go anywhere just say so, I haven’t actually decided where I want to go yet” Alibaba told her happily.



Morgiana gaped a bit. She hadn’t met anyone like that. Someone who could look past the fact that she was a slave and try to help her. After a few minutes, Alibaba sighed “Look, this happened a few months ago I probably wouldn’t have helped you. I’m just not in a great place with some of the higher ups of the city. If I was, I’d probably be to worried about myself to help you. I guess when I helped that little girl and her mother, it also made me grow a conscience”



Morgiana tilted her head. She vaguely recalled something about what he said. “Wait, did you kick down a bunch of barrels of wine to get the girl back from a man-eating flower?”



Alibaba looked at her a bit surprised “Yeah how did you know?”



“The fat man serves my mast... former master. He said something about a ‘blathering blonde idiot’ that hit him and wasted all of his wine ‘on a little runt’” Morgiana said, using air quotes. “My ma-former master took his frustration out on me after that” she said smiling.



“I feel terrible. Why are you smiling about that?”



“I was planning on running away at some point, but I lashed out when my former master was beating me and so I escaped then. You inadvertently caused my master to beat me that day, which made me run away onto this road the same day as you. If you hadn’t been here I probably would have been caught by those men”



Alibaba smiled “I guess we’re both lucky then” he told her. Morgiana tilted her head. She was someone whom he given food and precious water, not to mention he’d have to lie to people about her since she used to be a slave. “Look, I’m not going to lie that you’re trouble” Alibaba told her. Morgiana looked away, feeling a bit guilty “But having a travel companion is nice and I’m not a very trusting person. I know you won’t screw me over because you’ll be endangering yourself by doing so”



“That isn’t a very good base for a relationship” Morgiana said softly.



“Maybe not, but this way we both benefit. I’ll take care of you, and you’ll provide companionship. Hopefully given time it will grow into good friendship and we will know that we can rely on one another” Alibaba told her happily.



Morgiana squinted, looking down the road “It looks like they’re coming back” she commented. Both of them stood up and Alibaba opened the lid “Make sure the seat locks” he told her. She replied with a nod and the lock clicked automatically when he put down the seat.



Morgiana was a bit split. She completely trusted Alibaba at this point. He was kind, he given her resources that were quite precious in the desert, and had helped her hide from the men. She did, however, feel a bit sad that he didn’t trust her, although he had no reason to.



Alibaba sighed as the men came into view. They were the same men that had passed him earlier. As the men reached his position, they slowed down.



“I guess you didn’t find her?” Alibaba asked smiling and scratching the back of his head. Normally he wouldn’t have talked to them, but they had already pulled up next to his cart.



The leader sighed “Nope. We don’t have the resources to go out any further. Didn’t think that someone would be able to get this far in the desert on foot. Even a fanalis” he explained. Noticing the glance that Alibaba was giving him, the leader sighed “I’m just not too keen on going back and telling Lord Jamil that I failed”



Alibaba gave an apologetic smile “Yes, I’m glad I’m not the one telling him. Although I do feel a bit bad for that slave. The leader raised an eyebrow. “Well either she",candidate00007
"did a shitty job. And Zelda listened to her. He had come all this way and got this. At this point he didn’t particularly want to deal with shit like this anymore. He had come to get Zelda, but she decided to leave with the women.



“Screw this. If I’m not good enough for you then fine. I’m gone. Good luck with whatever the hell it is you’re doing” Link said and walked passed her.



Impa gaped. She had said that to try to motivate him, to push him to get stronger. Even if he couldn’t stand up to some opponents at the moment, he was still impressive in his skill. And he was Hylia’s chosen hero. He couldn’t just stop.



“Are you really so petty as to just quit from a few harsh words?” Impa asked, trying to get Link to turn back.



“You know what, I don’t really feel like arguing with you so yeah, sure I’m that petty ok. Besides, you seem perfectly capable, and as you’ve heavily implied, you are better than me, so why don’t you just do it” Link replied, slightly annoyed. Granted the woman saved Zelda’s life, but he after all they’ve been through in their lives she just left like that. If it was really that easy for her, then he didn’t care anymore.



Walking forward, Link used a skyward strike on the object in front of him, and watched as Fi skated around the water. After she was finished, he took the tablet and left, leaving a dumbfounded Impa in his wake.



On his way back to Skyloft, Fi repeatedly reminded him that this was against his best interests, which he ignored. If this entire thing really was something that he had to do to protect everyone, then he’d do it. Until he found proof of that, he was done.



Link sighed and relaxed as he rode his loftwing. He was by far the best rider in Skyloft. No one could keep up with him, and he could outmaneuver anyone in the air. Of course he also gave a large part of the credit to his loftwing, whom he loved.



With another sigh he contemplated where he should go. He didn’t particularly want to go back to the main island. Maybe having some pumpkin soup would help. Kina was also pretty cute. He didn’t particularly have anything better to do now, so he might as well.



Link had been forced to go are start fighting on the surface again. After he started helping out at the Lumpy Pumpkin and dating Kina, things had taken an obvious turn for the worse. Eventually he went down to the surface and started doing what Fi told him to. Eventually he ran into Impa again and did what she told him. Zelda, when he saw her, was ignored except for a glance when she came into view. Now everything with Ghirahim and Demise was over.



“Link, I just  wanted to say” Zelda started before being cut off.



“Look Kina wanted me to invite you to our wedding. If you want to come fine, if not then whatever. I’m only mentioning it because Kina wanted me to” Link said harshly.



Zelda nodded slowly, tears welling up in her eyes. She knew she shouldn’t think ill of Impa, but it was her that caused this. Zelda had dreams of growing up and marrying Link her entire life. That’s what she expected to happen. That’s what she knew he expected to happen. Link always hung around her, and he was the best guy in Skyloft in her opinion. He was talented in both fighting and flying. He had a good personality, if a bit lazy. He was laid back and would take shit from other people until they started to bother his friends. In her eyes he was perfect. All that was lost now.



“Look, it’ll probably be better if you just don’t come okay. I’m not telling you what to do here, I’m just saying” Link told her. With that said, he turned and left.



Zelda fell to her knees. This was the worst possible outcome for her. Not only was she not with Link, but he didn’t even seem to remotely like her anymore. Not even as an acquaintance. Zelda curled up into a ball on the ground and wished that she none of this had happened. It would have been better if Demise had succeeded.



Zelda pulled a knife out and held it at her own throat. Feeling the blade go across her neck, she dropped the knife before she could do anymore than draw a small line.



Laying on the ground she sobbed wishing Link would come back. As a love interest. As a friend. Even as a distant acquaintance. She at least wanted to be close to him. Maybe she’d be able to follow him as a spirit. With that thought, Zelda picked the knife up and before",candidate00007
"people, she'd rather let the civilians get hurt than watch Allen sacrifice his own health to not let a single person get hurt.

""Hey Lenalee, how did you know I was lost?""

""Well its ten minutes after lunch started,"" she replied with a smile.

Allen burst out laughing; it was actually kind of amusing that he was that predictable. ""Hey Allen do you mind helping me after you eat?"" Lenalee asked.

""Yeah sure, with what though?"" he asked tilting his head to one side.

""That’s a secret"" she replied with a giggle. Grabbing Allen, Lenalee jumped up a few floors.

""The cafeteria is"" Lenalee started.

""Second door on the right"" Allen finished. ""So I'll meet you at your room?""

Lenalee nodded and skipped away. Allen smiled, he was glad to finally have friends that he could depend on — something that was rare when traveling with an evil second only to the Earl.

Lenalee smiled as she walked away from Allen. She knew Allen would help her because that’s just who he was. She would keep him safe. The way he continuously put himself in harm’s way was bad for her health as well as his. Lenalee found that she was incapable of not worrying whenever her friends put themselves in excessive danger. And with Allen always doing his best to make sure that if anyone got hurt it was only himself, that meant it was emotionally bad for her.

Lenalee plopped herself on her bed. She smiled as she pulled out some chains from her closet. Because of her brother who seemed to attack any boys that even tried to flirt with her, she had the science team develop chains that none of his crazy inventions could break. As long as Allen's arm was injured, he would most likely not be able to break the chain.

After a few minutes Allen appeared at Lenalee's door. ""Allen what are you doing at Lenalee's door,"" Komui asked from behind Allen.

Allen stiffened ""She just asked for my help,"" he cried frantically as he covered himself with his arms. Lenalee opened the door with a glare.

""Sorry I have work I need to do,"" Komui yelled as he ran away.

Lenalee face palmed ""I'm sorry Allen, come on I'll show you what you need to do. Just sit on the bed for a minute,"" she told Allen pulled the chains out of the cover.

""Can you just hold this chain?"" Lenalee asked politely.

""Uh what's this for?"" Allen asked.

“Think of it like armor to keep you safe,"" Lenalee replied.

""Lenalee"" Allen said as he started to get up.

Lenalee quickly poked a needle into his leg ""Shh, just rest for a bit,"" she told him as she lowered him onto her bed.

Now that Allen was asleep, Komui's crazy sister complex was good for something at least, Lenalee proceeded to chain Allen's arms and legs to the bed posts. Lenalee quickly locked her door after she was finished with Allen.

""Silly boy always making me worry,"" Lenalee said to Allen's unconscious body. This was all just to keep him safe. As Lenalee laid down next to him she thought about it again. It was just to keep him safe right. She started to question her motives as she unconsciously snuggled closer to Allen. It didn't matter at this point; she would be able to let him go tomorrow.

With that thought Lenalee groaned as she ripped herself away from Allen. She had to tell Komui to send someone else on the mission; otherwise the akuma would probably get the innocence. Lenalee quickly hopped through the building to the science lab. ""Hey Brother,"" Lenalee called out.

""Yes my dear sister,"" Komui asked as he fluttered out from hiding.

""I need you to get someone else to go on Allen's mission, as much as he might want to go he isn't fit for duty yet,"" Lenalee explained.

""But Allen said he got a note from the nurse"" Komui said as he searched his pockets. ""You mean the nurse that will barely let anyone out of the infirmary if you have a scratch,"" Lenalee asked rhetorically.

Komui chuckled ""Yeah I guess I shouldn't have believed him. Anyways I'll send Miranda and Krory on the mission,"" Komui replied.

With that Lenalee skipped away. She now had all of today and tomorrow to spend with Allen... to keep him safe. Lenalee smiled, for now she could just go and cuddle with him. No matter which way she looked at it she just rationalized it by telling herself that it would keep him safe. Cuddling with him would help reduce the chance of him catching a cold or getting frostbite or pneumonia, which would be totally likely to happen if she wasn't there to keep him warm.

Allen opened his eyes and tried to sit up. Looking up at his hands he saw that they were chained to the bed. The last thing he remembered was Lenalee asking",candidate00007
"“Oh you think I’m pretty” Robin asked, trying to embarrass him or cause him to become flustered. Luffy nodded quickly and grabbed her by her sleeve and dragged her towards the kitchen.



As they entered the kitchen Robin found herself surprised. She knew she was pretty, and she could generally use that to her advantage against men. Luffy on the other hand seemed to hold no such thoughts like that towards her though.



“Cook-san can you make me some food” Robin asked.



Sanji’s eyes popped out and turned into hearts “I’LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU ROBIN-CHWAN” Sanji yelled as he quickly started cooking food.



“That looks good cook-san, but can you make some bigger as well” Robin asked. Sanji didn’t even respond as he started to prepare something else as well. Robin thanked Sanji and left with the food.



Luffy who had quickly been pushed out of the kitchen and lectured on how it was rude to drag a women, let his tongue hang out as soon as he saw the food. “Ah, thank you Robin” he said quickly “you’re going to be a great member of the crew” he added happily eating away at the food.
“You should eat, Sanji’s a really good cook” Luffy said holding Robin’s plate up to her face. Robin giggled as she took the plate, she had a feeling she was going to like being part of the Going Merry’s crew. This thought caused her to frown a bit.


A/N: I didn’t wanna try to write about Luffy and Lucci’s battle because it would take too much work and I’m skipping past the Going Merry’s funeral, so a day or two after they get on the Sunny and set sail.


Robin found herself drifting towards Luffy, since they had gotten on the sunny. She held no misconceptions of why she found herself drawn to Luffy. He had saved her, and made her want to live, not to mention his personality.



Luffy on the other hand was still slightly upset that Robin had been taken from him, even if it was her choice and he got her back. He felt himself start to get slightly paranoid, which was totally unlike him and he didn’t particularly like it. Walking towards Robin, Luffy thought about what he was going to do. After all it would be weird if he just went over and stared at her.



Robin looked over and saw Luffy walking towards her. As he Luffy came within arms reach of her she felt something form over her wrist. “LUFFY” Nami yelled storming over to them. “Why are you handcuffing Robin” she asked angrily. Luffy looked down at Robin’s wrist and saw that it was cuffed to his own.



Luffy looked at Nami and shrugged. Seeing Nami fuming, Robin started to giggle “It’s okay Nami, it just means he’s worried about me” she told Nami.



“Yeah, this is just to make sure that she doesn’t get taken away, cause then they have to fight me” Luffy added.



Nami stared at Luffy for a few seconds before coming to a realization “You didn’t even know what you were doing did you” she asked raising her hand to her forehead. Luffy shook his head drawing a giggle from Robin and a sigh from Nami.



“Don’t worry, if it starts to bother me I’ll tell him to take it off” Robin said with a smile.



Nami eventually walked away after Robin assured her that she didn’t mind being handcuffed to her captain. Robin smiled to herself, she really didn’t mind all that much. In fact the more she thought about it, the safer she felt. Being connected to Luffy like this actually brought her a large degree of comfort. As long as she was connected to him, he would never let anything happen to her.



As accepting as Nami was of Luffy handcuffing Robin to himself, Robin knew it would be a little weird explaining it to the rest of the crew... and what was Luffy planning once they had to go to bed.



“Come on Luffy, why don’t we go get some food” Robin suggested. It was about lunch time and everyone had disappeared so she assumed Sanji had at least started cooking and everyone was just waiting in the kitchen. Luffy paused, which Robin found odd seeing as they were talking about food.



“What are we supposed to do at night” Luffy asked. Robin gave him an odd glance, it wasn’t like him to think about these things ahead of time. “I don’t wanna drag you around while I’m trying to get food at night” he told her. Robin giggled, she should of seen that coming



 “What about sleeping arrangements” Robin asked. Luffy stared at her with a blank look on his. “Where are you going to sleep and where am I going to sleep” Robin clarified.



“In bed” came the simple reply. Robin raised an eyebrow and tapped the",candidate00007
"system. It was maybe ridiculous to think he would manage it, but there it was. The light was shitty in fits and starts, but that was half of the enjoyment. Maybe someone would have the balls it took to jump him and he could get some of his inner pissy aggression out for the evening.

He was angry and bored, and under-challenged at work, and he missed the army. He missed a lot of things, he missed, he -- and he couldn't stop playing that fucking IED blast through his head, he couldn't not-think about the way his hearing went after every shot, no matter how much earpro he used or what silencer he used with what type of lubricant. It was all there, sitting behind his eyes in every moment where he wasn't distracting himself.

""I can help you with that.""

There he was, leaning against a lamppost, light shining down on him as if it could somehow brighten who he was. Bastian was fairly certain that would be the biggest fucking lie imaginable.

""Don't think that I can't imagine exactly what's been going on, what you've been thinking. I can practically see the sparks behind your eyes, the way it's.... sssssearing you down to the bone.""

He felt his jaw flex before he clenched it tight and pressed his tongue against his teeth because he wasn't going to get another charge brought down on him. Wasn't. He was going to pretend he had a fucking grip on himself and not touch the man, not do a fucking thing. ""You need to either stop talking in riddles, or fuck off, little man.""

""You're bored. You are far too intelligent to be stuck in an office counting beans. I can help you with that. Give you something to do that you would prefer to the idiotic day to day grind of logistics, shipping things in and out and up and down when you could be doing something useful. Something exciting. I can give you that.""

He wanted it. He wanted that, he wanted to do something that mattered because he wasn't a pogue. That was what had driven him crazy as he'd made his way up the ranks, he didn't want to be a staffer, he wasn't into the powerpoint wars for funding that had to be done, wasn't into administrative drills rather than battle drills. ""What're you offering?""

The spread of Moriarty's arms were both invitation and explanation. ""So many things. All the money you could want.. No need to be bored or angry or anything because oh, baby, I can use all of your talents. Each and every one. All you have to do is say yes.""

He stepped in closer to the man. ""What the hell am I saying yes to?"" But all the money he could want, and his talents -- killing? Snapping? Every socially unwanted thing he'd ever fucking done during his career, the ones he'd managed to sweep under the table and the ones he hadn't?

There was just something about the sparkle of those eyes, the way he moved in a little too close, close enough that Bastian could seriously hurt him if he wanted to do it. The lack of fear was almost as delicious as it might have been if he had seemed afraid, and then he tilted up his head and breathed a response, the scents of mint and beer washing out with the words. ""Honey, you are saying yes to the adventure of your life.""

Unbelievable. Sebastian closed his eyes briefly, teeth still clenched. It was tempting; it was tempting and he wondered if he was going to have to say yes just to find out what it was, or if he could turn his back and head to his flat and go back to his other job and other life. ""From a scrawny little businessman who's just a little drunk.""

Drunk, but clearly sure of himself. ""I should think it would be reassuring that I'm not very, very drunk, but to each his own.""

Clearly the man was askew, but Sebastian closed his eyes. Worst case, he could say yes and then say no afterwards. ""Yes."" There weren't any rules about changing his mind after he got a hold of himself.

There was something about that smile, those teeth. ""Oh, you are going to love this.""

""I'd be more inclined to believe you if you told me what 'this' actually is."" He was naturally patient, able and willing to out-wait the smartest target because he would, eventually, slip up and show himself. Except in this case, the man was showing himself right there, but not what his hand was, not what he was carrying on about. Just his bright wild eyes.

""Some things require seeing in order to believe. This might take a day or two. Perhaps, oh, you should pack a bag."" A quick glance took him in",candidate00008
"anymore. He was a mess, in more ways than one, and he couldn't think of any way to fix anything. He was exhausted and messed up, and Gil was above him, hands touching his face with that weird lukewarm skin of his. ""I'm pretty fucked up.""

""We have time. I have time."" The implication that Greg could have time, too, was there. Gil was kissing him again then, and Greg could only relax onto the cushions, let Gil come over him, let Gil touch him. It was as good as he remembered, even though he didn't want it to be.

""Gil... I...""

""Mm?"" Just a quiet question, asked over another kiss against his mouth.

He didn't know. He couldn't say no, either; couldn't bring himself to do it, so he let his lips part and let Gil kiss him, teeth and all.

Teeth. He felt his tongue catch on one, and he recoiled even as Gil pressed him down against the mattress. It was enough to catch his attention, to make him give a noise of protest and turn his head away despite everything.

That was when Grissom growled, low in his throat. ""Dammit. What's wrong?""

""Teeth."" What the hell else was he supposed to say? Gil would know if he was lying, and Greg was shit for that. He wasn't going to hide this when he was already hiding so much.

""I won't bite you, I'm not going to hurt you. They're just... They're there."" Like Gil was, part of him now, but it still made Greg's heart rate ratchet in fear.

He licked his lips and ducked his head, because even if he was terrified, this was what he was here for. He was whoring in a rather special kind of way now, and he was going to have to control himself, even if he didn't want to. ""Okay. I just. I guess I wasn't prepared.""

He needed to find a way to get Sheppard into the building. If Gil slept for once, before he did, that could solve that. ""I wish you could enjoy this...""

""I can. I will. I need to..."" Greg dropped his head back and closed his eyes, sighing and parting his legs to let Gil slide deeper between them. ""Just let me learn.""

""I can hardly remember the last time you said that."" Learning. They'd done a lot of it, once, once upon a time, that seemed forever ago because it was. It was before everything went to hell, before he spent time doing things that would have made his mother sick to think of, just to eat, just to live. It was forever ago, when Gil cared enough about him that Greg didn't ever think he'd do anything like this.

""You mean with the chocolate pens?"" He did his best to smile, to be valiant about it.

""Huh, that would be when."" Gil smiled before leaning down and nipping gently at the line of his neck.

It scratched, tingled, and Greg couldn't help gasping, tipping his head back despite every instinct to do the exact opposite. Gil knew him, knew all of the ways to make him hot, and that faint scratchy nip had always been top of the list. He could come from it, Gil sucking, biting softly below his left ear, and wow, conditioned responses kind of sucked.

He was still conditioned to it, and Gil knew how to play him, how to do it so Greg went weak kneed, rubbery limbed against the mattress until fingers snuck down between his legs and palmed his dick through his clothes.

It made him pant, rocking up into Gil's touch, heat flushing through him. ""Jesus,"" he mumbled, and turned his face to the side, closing his eyes. ""Oh God.""

He wasn't touched a lot in his profession, weirdly enough. Most johns expected him to do the touching, wanted him pre-lubed so they could stick it in, do their business and go. He was considered a prissy bitch on his street, because condoms were a necessity, not an option, but even with the world as fucked up as it was, Greg didn't have a death wish. Not in any way, shape or form. He didn't need whatever vampire version of AIDS had probably worked its way into humanity, even if he was going to get it now, and if getting fucked up the ass turned him, fuck. Fuck.

""Tell me that feels good. I want you to feel good.""

""It feels good."" It wasn't a lie, either, because it did, and Gil was nuzzling him, lapping at that one spot, and he couldn't help shaking, rocking up into the hand that was still stroking him. Gil's fingers were as clever as they",candidate00008
"out near Baton Rouge for a few days getting to know Will before the accident even happened. Will had told him that much, and explained how he'd ended up with Will to start with. Getting over Sara and Gil had been the name of the game when he'd gone on vacation, and Will had made that happen. Will had been there to put the pieces together after the accident. Will had taken care of him, helped him, had been there. More than Gil ever had been. More than anyone ever had been, flexible to Greg's whims. They didn't even fight, not real drag down, car door slamming, stomping off to the beach fights. Well, maybe one or two of those.

Even those ended up pretty damn nicely. ""If you want to leave partway through, we'll go. I promise.""

""I know. It's stupid to be so uptight about this. I mean. They were my friends, before."" Before he'd found Will, and his life had gotten better. Different, maybe, but a lot better.

""It's not stupid. You left, severed ties. You're nervous about them for a reason, and it's probably why you left in the first place."" Will smiled, sliding his hands into his jeans pockets.

True. ""It just feels ridiculous, to be worried about Nick. He's... Nick's a good guy. He's the kind of guy you could trust with your life if you needed to. You know?"" He had, more than once. Nick was also vulnerable in a way that tempted bad people to prey on him.

Greg was glad he'd never had that particular problem.

""Then maybe it's not him making you nervous. Could it be people you associate with him?""

Gil.

Sara.

Warrick.

""You know the year before I left sucked. I guess it's just thinking about that, to be honest. And I could have done a better job of leaving. Could have come and packed up my own stuff, resigned in person.""

""Then let's tidy out what we can. I'll help."" He'd do anything Greg didn't want to do. He'd talk to Gil, if he showed up, although Greg didn't think he would.

They were coming up on the restaurant now. For a second, he reached over and grasped Will's hand tight, pulling a little courage together for himself. He wasn't sure if it was enough, but it would have to do, and so he reached for the door, and they stepped inside. It was a nice place, nice enough that Will had called about a reservation for themselves and for Stokes. It was just a matter of walking up to the hostess and saying ""Reservation for Graham.""

She looked up, all blonde French twist and prettily pursed red lips and smiled. ""Oh, yes. The other parties have already arrived. Just this way.""

Other parties. He had figured on it, and he'd hoped that wouldn't be the case, but there it was. Other Parties, and that could be almost anybody. Dammit, he didn't want to see anybody, not even Nick in particular. They'd ask questions and dig and there were parts of his life he didn't like to think about, much less explain.

Will moved his fingers, reached for Greg's hand again, and walked with him towards the table. There was Nick, and Catherine. Catherine, he'd missed Catherine, and there.... Oh god. That was Grissom. He looked so much older than he had. If Will hadn't been holding his hand, he would have bolted then and there. Taken a running leap right out of the place and he would have kept running all the way back to Mexico, maybe even further. Maybe all the way to South America, just to be sure. Not Costa Rica, though. He could see the wedding ring on Gil's finger. Costa Rica was verboten, for so many reasons. Shame there hadn't been any man-size human munching bugs down there, and the second he had the thought, he felt bad about it.

""Hey, Greggo. I, uh. Sorry, I didn't mean to overwhelm you or anything. I mentioned to Catherine that I saw you today and then..."" Nick shrugged. ""I had to beat everybody off with a stick.""

Will's fingers shifted, squeezed gently as if to urge him on. ""We don't leave home very often. First real vacation we've taken in a while. I'm, uh, actually only half familiar with you all,"" Will said as he slid into the chair near the wall, leaving Greg the outer edge. There were so many reasons to love Will, and that was just one of them.

""Wow, nice to know we're just that",candidate00008
"and snow in cases was usually shoulders up around his ears and stress and frosty noise and pain. He scooted his chair back, well aware that all eyes were on the two of them.

It was easy enough; Greg tugging him up and out of the room, and none of them seemed bothered by it, didn't seem to mind them leaving without so much as a by-your-leave. There were coats and scarves at the door, hats, gloves. They didn't so much seem to belong to anyone as they were there for whoever came by and needed them. Greg rifled through them, pulling out bits that seemed to work, and then he began bundling Will up in them, still with that little secret smile that seemed to say he was going to enjoy the hell out of whatever came next.

He had an urge to hug Greg, randomly, and instead just went with it, drifting a little and grinning as he pulled on a pair of gloves that were too big. There were others, of course there were, but he liked the feel of those, and Greg seemed to, as well. Hell, Greg had gloves for all kinds of seasons and reasons, thin cotton, thick leather, multiple colors and styles. Today's were more like mittens, thick wool with an inner liner that was water-resistant, and Will could feel the plans he seemed to be making at the back of his head.

Snowball fights. Why not?

He shifted his focus away from Greg, wanted it to be a fair fight for at least once. Then again, Greg had all the experience and he wasn't going to cheat and work out how best to make a snowball. ""Should we stake out positions, or? All I can think of is that Donald Duck cartoon.""

""With the nephews as pinballs?"" Greg grinned at him. ""I say we go ahead and set up an ambush point. I'll show you how to make the best snowballs, and then...."" His eyebrows wriggled with enthusiasm. ""We'll go against one another until we find a better target.""

""Yes! I want to watch stupid cartoons, now."" Will leaned over to rub his arm, and decided he liked that plan best of all. He wasn't used to competing with Greg on anything other than the odd game that Greg kicked his ass in, and their regular paintball sessions with Sheppard and McKay. They got their ass kicked together, then.

Greg's grin was full of energy. ""When we're done burying my cousins in snow. Loony Tunes and hot chocolate. Now c'mon.""

It was an odd thing to feel anxious over, but it spoke to the importance of Greg in his life.

~*~*~*~

Greg's tension had ratcheted up to match his father's, but they were all tense to the point where it made him wonder why they bothered going. It was clear that everyone enjoyed it almost to the point of wrist-slitting being preferable, but people did strange things for family.

Very strange things, considering Greg had pulled on his thickest set of leather gloves before they'd even left the house -- not good driving ones, but the ones he used at especially bad scenes before he decided exactly what to touch and whether the resulting nose bleed would be worth it.

It put Will in a bit of a mean mood, probably unnecessarily so, but he dealt with life with humor, and waiting for things to go wrong. He was waiting, too, for something to cross his senses, left everything wide open just in case. Left himself open because he had a feeling, something like a tongue probing at a sore tooth.

Something off.

Being open wasn't so bad around the Hojem lot. They were all pretty mellow, and the worst fight so far had been Dalla and Disa bickering about how much chili powder actually went in the chili they were making for supper. Being open on the way to visit people who so clearly left Greg and his parents feeling grim and unhappy, well. It was a completely different matter, then, one that left him suspicious and twitchy. 

Half thoughts and fears and just dread, thick and clinging to everyone in the van, and Will mostly preferred to think about the horror of why on earth Greg's parents had a van, and guesses at what they did in it when they were driving through more than one state.

""Don't think about it,"" Greg advised, voice a bare murmur. ""They'll tell you about their experience with the El Camino at some Pink Floyd concert. That never ends well for anyone.""

""Why, were you conceived there?"" Will asked, half facetiously, and then realized that, yeah, maybe he shouldn't have whispered anything.

Audun laughed, not her usual kind of laugh, but nice all the same. ""Actually, I'm pretty sure that was after a particularly good birthday party with far too many margaritas. It was...""

""LALALALALA,"" Greg yelled, winking. ""Don't damage me",candidate00008
"Dean was pretty sure he had this thing down.

It wasn't like it was all that hard, really. Or, okay, yeah, maybe it was all that hard, but not difficult. Not once he'd figured out exactly what made Cas all hot and bothered and horny, anyway.

Dean Winchester knew all about horny.

He was pretty sure that he was either living in a time bubble or Castiel was otherwise tweaking at the world because there had to be other things they could be doing instead of hanging out there. There were definitely other things they needed to be doing, but... He could think to bend over the car.

In fact, he could enjoy the shit out of bending over the car. He was wearing a tattered t-shirt and a pair of jeans that hugged his ass like a second skin, and he could feel Castiel's eyes on him as if they were hands.

Castiel's eyes were gorgeous, and hot, and if the angel had turned him into some kind of honest to god sex slave, he was going to have his fuzzy winged balls on a platter beside a baked potato. For now it felt kind of good to fuck with him, though. Well, and to fuck with him, but more the teasing thing.

In Dean's experience, teasing was something chicks did. He was almost always good to go for sex type relations, so teasing wasn't any kind of vitally necessary response for him, or it hadn't been, anyway. Not until he realized just how hot it made Cas when he worked on crap.

Mmmmm. That had been one fucking awesome learning experience.

The hotter Cas was, the more pent up he was, the better it was. There had been a lot of sex in Dean's life, a wide range of tastes and styles, and getting fucked by Castiel was up there at the top. Getting fucked by three days of horny Castiel was even better.

Now he just had to work it a little more to get him riled up enough to come and get it.

Standing up, Dean rubbed his forearm across his forehead and laid down the wrench he'd been using. Reaching down, he grabbed the bottom of his t-shirt and pulled it up and off, and wow. If he'd thought Cas's gaze had weight before, he was pretty sure it was on fire now.

He shifted, rocking on his heels, and just watched, arms stiffly at his side, almost restrained while he watched and watched. Dean scratched at his stomach, and Castiel groaned.

Aw, yeah. He totally had every ounce of attention all for himself, and it felt good. Now if Cas would just let go enough to fuck him there while he was bent over his baby, life would be so good.

He just watched, though, lingering. Dean bent in for a moment, and then looked up again, not quite surprised that Castiel had seemed to move three feet closer. It was kind of like feeding feral cats sometimes.

""Hey, Cas. You wanna hand me that spanner?"" Never mind that he had no idea what excuse he'd need to give for wanting it. Didn't matter.

Cas leaned in, handed it to him, and then leaned back, still watching his ass closely.

It was going to be a long day.",candidate00008
"can imagine what's inside of it. But it's designed in such a way that I can control how much kryptonite radiates through. After the outer layer, there are interwoven meshes. I'm quite pleased with it, for a workbench piece.""

Yeah, that was a little... nerve-wracking, actually. Kryptonite wasn't what Kon would call fun. Early exposure pretty much proved to him that it hurt like a mofo and puking didn't seem like a sex kind of behavior. ""I'm imagining it. I'm not that sure I like the sound of it.""

""Just... hold your hand out. And trust me, Kon."" He slid his thumb over the top as he put a knee on the edge of the bed nearest to Kon. Nothing that he could feel yet, until he turned it to press against Kon's palm.

Fuck.

Fuck, that was... that was weird. That was just eighteen fucking kinds of weird, and it hurt, made him vaguely nauseated but it wasn't vein-bubbling shuddering bad. ""Ngh.""

""I can make it stronger... or weaker. How does that feel? The first setting was just a guess."" Setting and stronger or weaker, when Kon was pretty sure that it was just kryptonite beneath wire, but it was hard to tell with Lex.

""Feels..."" Bad. Weird. Good, when Lex reached out with his left hand and stroked a thumb gently over his skin. ""Oh. Shit."" He couldn't tell.

A funny smile played over Lex's mouth, and he shifted his other hand on the slender card. Kon could suddenly feel more, and the curve of a fingernail against the back of his hand.

That was... Weird. The whole thing, and then the press of Lex's thumb slid up and over the bone of his wrist, caressing faintly, and that was so much sensation compared to what he normally felt. ""Oh.""

""I'm making the assumption that it's a close approximation of what people without the TK field feel."" Lex was taking his time with his fingertips, dragging them, stretching them across Kon's lower arm, the sensitive inside.

""I've never been normal."" Lex's right hand remained carefully to the side because he probably didn't feel as much from it, neuron wiring aside. ""It's kind of..."" Neat, and strange, and the funny hot-flushed-hurt-tad-queasy feeling wasn't going away, but it was maybe worth it for the way that thumb rubbed at the inner crook of his elbow, making him moan. Wow.

He could feel, more than pressure, more than a push against his skin, even if he had to feel sick and achy to get that feeling. ""Kind of...?""

""I don't know."" There was no way to describe it, and he drew in a shaky breath, drawing his hands into loose fists. He couldn't know how touching  would be affected right now, couldn't know if he would hurt Lex in the situation they were in right now. Hurting somebody and sex didn't much go hand in hand for him.

""Easy. Easy. Just relax, Kon."" His fingers trailed back up to Kon's wrist, trying to get him to open his hand. ""I think you'll be fine.""

""Think."" Yeah, but he was already sex-raspy, and he couldn't help letting his fingers loosen, still curled but not so tightly. Lex was stupidly inclined towards risk, but then, pretty much anybody having sex with a Kryptonian probably had a secret death wish somewhere deep. ""Okay.""

Okay because it was easier, okay because Lex was so fucking hot, okay because no matter what, that willingness to take risks was part of what made this so damned hot.

""Good."" He exhaled, moved his fingers over from arm to chest, caressing slowly over Kon's pectoral.

God.

Fuck, he was going to propose if everything kept feeling this fantastic, never mind the creeping pain radiating from the parts of him most exposed to that device. More than fantastic, amazing, and he couldn't help drawing in a shuddery breath. Jesus, god. That was completely amazing, fantastic enough that he could totally ignore the bad side of the kryptonite exposure. Weird combination, pleasure and uncomfortable fucking nausea pain but it was working for him for now. He could make it work, just because, sensation. Sensations he'd never felt before. Sensations he wanted to feel again and again, and he'd bet Lex could come up with a way without it feeling like kryptonite exposure, could come up with a way that he could feel his nipple being tweaked like that without the other edge, and then he moaned because ow. Ow, that was good and bad and good and wow. Wow, that pinch was fucking amazing.

Words were kind of failing him just at the moment because holy fucking shit",candidate00008
"the sofa before Lian sat up and glared at Lex. His expression was hard, a little angry, and he seemed pissed.

Lex moved to hang his jacket up, nonplussed as he passed by Lian. ""Glad to see that my little brother thinks he's my keeper.""

""Someone has to be, Lex."" The sentence was hard, spoken harshly. ""If I didn't think I had the job, you'd be dead right now.""

""Really?"" Keep it calm and bored, Lex reminded himself. It was the only way for his brother to not know that he was following the bait.

""Yes, really."" Lian was nearly snarling with fury as he rose up and crowded Lex back against the cabinet full of liquor and glasses towards which he'd been moving. ""You didn't think you'd just magically escaped that fucking Porsche, did you?""

Trapped animals could either run for it, run in sheer fear, or stand their ground. The ones that stood their ground probably faced the same fate as the other two options, but at least Lex would be able to feel better about his fate for having stood his ground.

""I thought I had,"" Lex drawled carefully, taking a step towards the cabinet as if he didn't feel Lian's presence close behind him.

The faint brush of his brother's hands traced across his hipbones as Lian breathed the answer into his ear. ""You didn't, Lex. There's a reason I didn't call you, Lex. I knew that you were safe. Lex.""

Steady hands were important. Lex shoved down a shiver, picking up a bottle of his favorite brandy. ""You're telling me that you pulled me out.""

""I'm telling you that you'd be dead right now if I hadn't followed you to Smallville. I've been here off and on for two weeks before now, so get used to it, Lex. I'm not leaving.""

Not words that were easy to digest. Lex closed his eyes for a moment, blindly picking up a glass for his drink. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""Would it have made you happy?"" God, those hands were still on him. ""No. It would have just pissed you off that I pulled you out of that river. You want to be the dead son to my favorite, Lex. I won't let that happen.""

""And here I thought that was why you followed me to Smallville. To drive my sanity over the bridge and be rid of me once and for all."" Common sense told him that was why Lian was there; self-pity said it was because Lian needed to show him up to shine all the brighter; self-hatred said that it was because Lian was unaware of Lex's thoughts, innocent in at least one aspect.

Proper brothers didn't hold each other at the hip like Lian was doing.

""You're never going to be rid of me, Lex,"" Lian murmured huskily against his ear. ""You're never going to find yourself without me. And I refuse to ever be without you. You're my brother, Lex."" You're my everything, he didn't say.

""Then you probably need to move your hand from near my crotch,"" Lex murmured, taking a step towards and into the table, and then a smooth side-step in the fractional space he'd afforded himself.

""Does it make you nervous, Lex?"" Lian allowed him that movement, and they both knew it. He couldn't have stepped away if Lian hadn't been willing to allow it. ""I assume that's why you've locked the door between us.""

""I enjoy the facade of privacy -- hence, I locked the door. If you hadn't mauled the handle, you and I both know that you could've picked it in a second."" He'd retreated, but only far enough to try to stab in a deflecting blow at his brother.

""That's not the point, Lex. It's not ever going to be the point. We both know I could break down the wall if I really wanted to."" Lian moved away from him, and Lex knew his retreat was more than allowed; that it was also driving Lian to fit-throwing proportions.

""But you won't,"" Lex countered, turning smoothly to look at Lian and pour himself his drink at the same time. ""Being so rash would be highly counterproductive for you.""

It would, and they both knew it. Even if Lian didn't want to admit it. ""I'm going to have what I want, Lex. You can't get out of it. Dying isn't an option any more than killing yourself with all of that shit you snorted and shot up was.""

Funny how Lian was wrong. Lex had assumed he simply couldn't die, and now... now to know that he",candidate00008
"Out With A Bowling Pin Before.



Hey know, that's discriminatory! I ain't no bowling pin - I'm a motherfucking juggling club, not some namby-pamby pin that exists purely to be knocked down by some asshole spheroid!



I Apologize For Insulting You But Could You Please Tone Down Your Profanities?  Your Language Is Clashing With The Sumptuous Surroundings.



Okay okay, I'm sorry for yelling, but it just really gets on my nerves when people make baseless derogatory assumptions like that.



Again I Did Not Mean To Insult You.



I know babe, I know, and I'm sorry for my outburst.  It's just something I have to deal with on a regular basis, you know?  And I mean, I look nothing at all like a bowling pin! Those assh- er, those jerks are squat and round while I'm pleasingly lanky.



I Must Admit You Are Well-

And so are you, babe.  Love the dress, by the way, very classy, yet it doesn't hide your stunning figure.



Oh Um Thank You. I Actually Designed It Myself.



No shit!  Really?



Yes Shit.  Hee Hee.



Ha ha ha ha! That was a good one!  Man, you're beautiful, talented, and got a sense of humour to boot! What are you doing here with a grungy club like me?



Oh Don't Say That I Think You Are Actually Very Handsome.  Your Blue Tie Sets Off Against Your White...



Um...



Skin?



Very Nicely.



Sure babe, you can call it skin if that works for you.  So, going back to my original question, what do you like to do for fun? Design clothes?



Yes I Enjoy Aesthetic Design Very Much And Am Actually Finishing Up Design School Currently.  I Also Like To Read.  But Generally I Just Like Making Things - Clothes Especially - But I Enjoy All Sorts Of Physical Creation And Manifestation.  I've Even Been Known To Partake In Woodworking.



Man, and all I'm good at is being flipped around in the air!



Hee Hee Well You Do Look Very Aerodynamic.



Well, maybe if you play your cards right, later I can show you just how aerodynamic I can be. ;)

You Know What I Meant. What Do You Like To Do For Fun?



Well, I live a very active life, obviously, so most of my leisure time is spent being, well, leisurely - you know, hanging out, watching TV, resting, and lots of sleep.  My day job tires me out like you wouldn't believe.



I Would Imagine So.



Plus my klutz of an owner drops me fairly often, so I need plenty of rest to recuperate.



Does Being Dropped Actually Physically Hurt You?



Well, usually not, but it hurts emotionally, you know?  It's like he doesn't really care.



There There I Am Sure It Is Not Intentional He Is Just A Little Prone To Accident.



Yeah, I guess.  So anyway, that's mostly what I do for fun, but if I'm well-rested and I have a little extra time off, then I like to go... clubbing.

"and heightening the particular fantasy Dirk had running through his head.

 

Dirk, on all fours, wiggled his ass up and down, causing the ""handlebars"" of the JPEG to stroke up and down his legs, sending a shiver down Dirk's spine.  As Dirk continued, he pondered which toy to use next.  River?  Thematic, yes, but too similiar to One and Two.  Sun?  A classic, to be sure, but a little to plain for Dirk's current mood.  Rice field? Car? Sushi?  Don't make him laugh.  If only... Dirk stared longingly at Woman - how he desperately wished he was up to the challenge (the irony of using such an object was undeniable) - but he knew he just wasn't cut out for it.  Maybe with some more practice, but with that long horizontal line he just wasn't go to get anywhere far with it.  Dirk sighed and grabbed Man - maybe he could claim double reverse irony?  But he really didn't care at that moment about irony, he just needed MORE.

 

Dirk yanked the Mountain out of him, gasping a bit at the sudden sensation of emptiness.  He quickly stuffed the Man inside him - too quickly.  Grunting with pain, he grabbed the two handles now sticking out of his butt, and used them to manuever the square box into a more comfortable position, and tried to relax around its girth.  In about a minute, the pain had ceased, and he started to ride the familiar train higher and higher into pleasure.  Dirk could feel his cock hardening as he slowly but surely started to pummel himself in the ass, both hands still gripping his ""tails"".  Soon though, he was already bored, and he needed more.  More carefully this time, he eased Man out of him, and with a wicked grin, picked up Small.

 

While Small was indeed not the largest toy in his collection, it had two loosely connected angled rods which he just adored.  He couldn't get enough of the feeling of them slowly but surely widening him out at an angle, preparing him for further pleasures.  Fortunately, the connection between the main rod and the two angled ones was rather strong this time - while no connection appeared on paper, you could always count on extra lines, bumps, squiggles, et cetera with his Bro's camera.  Not to mention the colors and patterns - Dirk had long since stopped paying attention to those, because they sometimes hindered his otherwise profound enjoyment.  After just a few minutes with Small, Dirk was ready for Big.  While similiar in some ways to Woman, Big's horizontal line was somewhat smaller, and there was more length to be enjoyed before reaching that killjoy.  Usually Dirk used Big as a palate cleanser, something smaller to psyche himself up for the final toys.  But today Dirk decided to flip the tables on the irony of using Small as a big toy and Big as a small toy - he was going to take Big all the way.

 

Dirk easily inserted the top length, savoring this painless pleasure for a few seconds, gritted his teeth, and then began to work the rest of the JPEG inside himself.  It took many minutes of straining and self-encouragement, but he finally had half of Big inside him - he couldn't help but feel proud.  But he wasn't done yet.  The tapered tails of Big terminated in points even wider apart than the width of the first half of Big, and he couldn't wait.  But he had not anticipated how hard moving the rest of Big inside him would be, even with half of it in.  The horizontal length did NOT want to go any further, and Dirk eventually had to concede defeat.  As he removed Big, he cried out in pain, and he felt something dripping down the back of his legs, but his erection was now stark and hard as a rock.  Dirk considered Meat, another toy he had long lusted after purely for connotative reasons, but he just couldn't take something so squaroid again, not after Big.

 

Dirk returned to Small as he contemplated what to finish himself off with.  His erection was straining against gravity, and despite the recent pain, pleasure had quickly overwhelmed him, and he knew he was running out of time.  Suddenly, a flash of inspiration hit him, and he grabbed the pen and paper, and scrawled a sigil as best he could, and took a terribly shaky pic.  Dirk almost ceased all activity when he saw the output.  It was... it was... perfect.  The delicious-looking hook was there, but now the three errant droplets had been strung along, connected to the bottom of the hook.  Dirk hastily removed Small, and then, slowly, reverently inserted Heart.

 

The three big pearls slipped inside him, one after another, with the most delicious sensations.  Dirk's head was already swimming, and he was finding it hard to keep his glasses on.  But when he inserted the whole length, save the hook, he couldn't keep from screaming in frenzied pleasure.  He knew he wouldn't",candidate00009
"he had cosmic inevitability on his side, as from his perch in his moon mansion, he saw a very small meteor plummet towards Alternia.

 

Tavros yelped and nearly toppled backwards out of his chair as a small rock hurtled into his hive, barely missing his carefully constructed deck, and completely obliterating Stop Being The Troll Other Trolls Want To Troll, And Become The Troll Who Trolls Other Trolls - An Instructional Twelve Step Guide With Informational Charts And Appendices.  As the puff of charred pages slowly floated back to the ground, Tavros noticed there was a dark green piece of... well it couldn't be paper, it'd have burnt off... wrapped around the rock.  He wheeled over and managed to scoop it up.  It certainly felt like paper...

 

Written on the paper in perfect white script, was simply ""Please highlight the mysterious blank spaces, Mr. Nitram"".  Confused, Tavros hastily scooted around back to his husktop, and highlighting the vast expanses of white, and proceeded to read line after line about how Tavros wasn't going to read this text until he was reading this and ha ha hee hee hoo hoo I'm so self assured and - Tavros had to stop reading.  He just couldn't take this strange man's cocky assertiveness, and decided to give him a piece of his mind.

 

""sO, I WANTED TO TELL YOU"", he typed, ""tHAT YOU ARE VERY SELF-ASSURED, aND KIND OF, cOCKY, aND I WAS WONDERING IF, yOU'D KINDLY, uM, tEACH ME HOW TO BE LIKE YOU? iF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU?""  Immediately, white text sprang forth, which Tavros quickly highlighted, to read:

 ""Mr. Nitram, normally I would be delighted to help you, but as you no doubt are unaware, but I am very much aware, I am very busy at this time, and I'm afraid I really can't afford to take the time to teach you to be just as suave, self-confident, and as excellent a host as me.""  Tavros slumped his shoulders in familiar defeat.  ""But please do right your shoulders, dear boy,"" the white text continued, ""as I'm willing to make you a deal.  Are you, by any chance, familiar with a game called 'Fiduspawn'?""  Tavros excitedly typed back that he was, amazed at his luck.  ""Excellent.  Of course, any pretense of chance I may have implied to you previously was of course an illusion.  We are both of course familiar with Fiduspawn, and soon, we will begin playing said game under a wager of sorts.  Simply put, if you win, I will take time out of my busy schedule to teach you my ways.""

 ""bUT, uM, wHAT IF YOU WIN?""

 ""Then I will take time out of my busy schedule to teach you my ways.""

 ""aLRIGHT, iT'S A DEAL,"" Tavros typed back, and gathered up his cards and host plushie.  He was going to go back to Trollian and ask how the mysterious man intended to play without being in the same room, when suddenly another rock flew into Tavros' hive, destroying nothing of note, but widening the hole in his wall considerably.  Wrapped around the meteorite was another plushie, but this one seemed even more full than usual.  Tavros watched in astonishment as the plushie unwound itself from the rock, bent over, and vomited out a stack of cards, which it began to shuffle.  This was certainly an unusual Fiduspawn match he was about to play, but even if he lost, Tavros was assured to get what he wanted nevertheless.

 Tavros put up a valiant effort, but eventually his death points had accrued 23, one more and it would be Game Over.  Fingers trembling, he reached into the deck and - AHA! Grinning, Tavros slapped down Leavings Technician, causing two damage to his opponent, bringing their Death Points up to 13, and allowing him to search his desk, remove all three Sentient Hoofbeast Leavings, and put them all in play.  ""Um, your turn!"" he said to the ever silent plush he was playing against, already starting to feel a bit of confidence, and his training hadn't even begun yet!  His opponent plush seemed like it was thinking hard about its options, and then suddenly whisked all of his active cards into the discard pile.

 ""So, you concede, then!"" Tavros started to say, when the host plush slapped down Rise With Ashes.  Tavros gasped - it was arguably the most powerful, and inarguably the most rare card in the whole game.  It required intense sacrifice, but promised wondrous rewards.  Tavros gulped and looked at his own plush, from which suddenly erupted a scaley little monster.  Tavros groaned, and turned to shake hands with his opponent, but stopped as a strange green light started to crackle around the room.  He watched, transfixed, as the opponent plush grew, and changed, until suddenly there was a four foot tall person with a large, perfectly round, white head before him.

"to claim our prize and enter our new world.  The final universe.  The end of the chain.

 

And we did.

 

But it wasn't a new world. Not really.

 

And it definitely wasn't final.  Not if I have anything to say about it.

 

====-====

 

You see, Dave had a good reason to be freaked out about something.  He always did have an uncanny sense of time.  You remember when I told you about how the smallest piece of data could bring down even the most complex of programs?  It turns out that at the moment we slew the Gray Monarch we were 4 days, 13 hours, 6 minutes, and 12 seconds into our session. 

 

I told you we were fast.

 

Some process running in the background of the universe recorded this timecode, and normally that data would have just been stored, for, I dunno, a high-score table? Data analysis?  Are there possibly beings above our realm of comprehension who need user stats, to balance the playing difficulty of the universe or whatever?  I don't even want to think about that.  But instead of taking up space on some pan-dimensional hard drive or being made into the spreadsheet that runs all existences, those particular numbers freaked the system the hell out.  It's no one's fault, really - programs, like ectobiology, are tricky things.  That's what bug testing is all about - you never know what combination of seemingly random and unrelated scenarios and datae will cause an adverse reaction.

 

But for some reason, thinking back on it, I get the strange feeling that maybe this wasn't an accident.  Maybe this wasn't a glitch.  Maybe it was intended.

 

But that really doesn't matter now.

 

 

====-====

 

 

So, that's how I ended up here: Universe i.  As in the square root of negative one.  You know how in old school games like the original Mario, or the first couple Pokemon games, you could glitch yourself into a strange area of the game, made up of random bits of previously used code?  Negative world, or Glitch zone, or whatever?  This is the universe we ended up in.  But here's the thing about those glitchy areas of video games - they only look glitchy if you've actually played the game in its functioning state.  But if the only Pokemon you've ever encountered was Missingno, you'd take it for granted that all Pokemon looked like vaguely phallic blocky shapes.  And for some reason, I'm the only one that remembers that Pokemon actually look like vaguely phallic blocky shapes with giant eyes and some shitty pun as a name.

 

So here I am - every day I have to go out and exist in this society, and I'm the ONLY ONE who sees how fucked up it is.  The moons.  The way streets are laid out.  Her Delirious Conksucksion.  Even indoor plumbing didn't make it through the... the whatever happened to us.  It wasn't a Scratch.  Not really.  And I've long since given up hope that this is a doomed timeline, and relatively soon, all this would vanish.  But it many ways it was a reset of some sort, or more accurately, a rewind.  The kind that messes up your tape.  You know how the places of Ancestors and Younglings switch in the case of a Scratch?  Well, with our, yeah, let's call it a Rewind, we all got switched back to our original factory settings.  No longer Dirk Strider, I am now once again Bro, the faceless automaton.

 

And I am alone.

 

 

====-====

 

 

Well, not truly alone.  Now I have you. 

 

Mmmmmm, you do know how treat a boy right, don't you?

 

Mmmmm...

 

Yesssssssssssss

 

Ahem.  There's plenty more of that where it came from, but I need to finish telling you this.  Where was I?

 

Ah, right, Alone.  Well, we both know that's not strictly true, but, present company excluded, I wish it was.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to see your best friends, your family, and have most of them not remember you at all, and NONE of them remember everything you all had been through?  I've put a lot of thought into why I remember when no one else does.  I've also spent a lot of time wondering if maybe what I ""remember"" never happened.  Maybe this insanity truly is perfectly normal.  But, no, I must believe that everything I know we went through truly happened - there really is no Alterniative.  Sorry, alternative.  Post-Rewind Dave has this terrible habit of making incredibly shitty puns, and I fear it's been wearing off on me.

 

Anyway, I think I may have figured out why I remember the little I do, when everyone else remebers nothing.  You see, I was the only one who didn't hit God Tier.  We all planned it so we could lie on our Quest Beds, fall peacefully asleep, and be killed instantly and painlessly, so",candidate00009
"survive the brooding caverns, nonetheless ever become a person of any interest, even an omniscient, nearly omnipotent being like himself needed downtime.

As Doc Scratch watched the progress of the small brown-blooded grub, however, he found himself concentrating less and less on his endless inner monologue, and more on the actions of the grub he was watching. So far it had passed all but the most difficult challenge of the brooding caverns, evading wild Alternian animals, managing to skitter over relatively large chasms, and even evading geysers of randomly spouting acidic rain - using a rhythmic sort of dance, no less! Sure, some grubs just charged straight through that challenge, and the ones that died, died, and the ones that survived were made hardier for their trials. But this grub was displaying a surprising knack for evasion, not something Doc Scratch had carefully groomed this species to be naturally adept at.

As the grub entered the final cavern, Doc Scratch began to watch in something akin to real interest, a feeling he had not felt in quite some time. The final cavern was in fact one of many final caverns in the brooding complex. They had been designed to funnel roughly the same number of grubs to each of the hundreds of final chambers, from which many grubs would enter, but only one could leave, ensuring that only the strongest of the strong would make it into troll society.  As dozens of grubs charged at each other, tackling, scratching, and gnawing until blood and pulp lay strewn about the cavern floor, the small brown grub skittered up onto a ledge, and carefully edged its way along it, above the action, and towards the exit, from which it would follow more corridors until it wound up running into the lusus that would take care of it for the rest of its life.

 Meanwhile, the grubs fighting on the ground had been narrowed down to five, and the fighting had gotten truly vicious. Doc Scratch was silently commending the young brown grub on its strategy of waiting and then pouncing when they were all exhausted, showing cunning and ruthlessness, but he was almost positive that even with that advantage the grub would not survive a battle with any of the grubs below, nonetheless the large blue one that was assuredly going to win.

And thus the large blue-blooded grub did win, but Doc Scratch didn't even feel his usual smugness at being correct (and since he was always correct, there was hardly a time when he wasn't smug), for he was ever so slightly... sad? Disappointed? These were not familiar emotions to him. But nevertheless, he felt some sort of... longing, he guessed, for the brown-blooded grub to make it out alive, but there was no way it could win against the... wait, what's this?

Doc Scratch refocused his omniscience, and saw that during the fray the small grub had simply exited the cavern, technically completing his trials.  Doc Scratch chuckled to himself - the grub had showed not ruthlessness, but cunning of a different sort. It had done its best to stay alive, and succeeded.  Doc Scratch continued to watch as the grub was found by a small winged lusus, not much bigger than the grub itself, and the lusus garbled a name to the small grub.

""Tavros... Nitram. Hmmm... I will have to keep an eye on you, young Mister Nitram."" Doc Scratch then spent many happy hours internally monologuing about how he couldn't actually keep an eye on the young troll due to his lack of any actual eyes.

Enthusiasm is just one of the many traits Doctor Scratch admires in his favorite pupil.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Doctor Scratch was well known for playing favorites and having star students, and this year's crop was no exception. It might not have been the most strictly rule-abiding way of doing things, but ""Doc"" Scratch hadn't gotten a cushy teaching job at Skaia University with a frankly ludicrous tenure clause in his contract by playing the rules. After all, he himself had been helped out when he was a lad by superiors who noticed his talent and keen intellect, and it was nothing if not his duty to do the same for this next generation of rising stars. It was just his way of being... what was a good way of putting it? Ah, yes. Hospitable.

There were plenty of excellent students to show favoritism to this year - Miss Lalonde was certainly deserving of it (much more attentive than her equally talented but unfortunately distracted older sister), but Miss Serket had an undeniable streak of ambition that Scratch could not help but admire. These and many others would all be obvious candidates for some... extra guidance... but Scratch had found him irrevocably drawn to a rather unlikely student - Mr. Nitram. Truth be told, besides a quick appraisal of the width of the wheelchair the mohawked boy had wheeled in on and whether or not the exactingly tidy rows of desks in his classroom would have to be adjusted (they did not), he at first spared the boy barely a first glance, not to mention a second one.

But as the",candidate00009
"Derse lay still and quiet.  Night-time, or what passed for night-time on the perpetually dark planet, hung thick and heavy like the internet's stereotyped pre-conception of what a naked human male with a high concentration of melanin in his pigment looks like.  The Black Queen slipped silently through the shadows.  She was sure her Archangent, Jack Noir, would be monitoring the throne room and wonder where she was off to, but she didn't care.  The little game they played had long grown stale, and she hungered for fresher, sweeter meats.  With calculated speed and skill, she scrambled up the long chain that connected Derse to her moon, and the Dersites to their Dreamers.

The chain was old and pockmarked, and the Queen could skitter up its underside like an insect.  After an hour of hard work (and a few brief pauses), the Black Queen had finally scaled all the way to the top of the chain, and took a few laboured steps on Derse's moon, before resuming her usual graceful, confident stride.  You could say she was an adept... strider.

Moving quickly now, as her hunger was starting to reach its peak, the Black Queen hurried into one of the towers of the Derse Dreamers.  Knowing there was no need, she opened the door quietly, and snuck inside.  She knelt before the youngling on its bed, and removed the covers with an almost tender air.  Licking her lips, heart thumping in her chest, she eagerly put one long smooth hand inside the young boy's pants, and began stroking his... wait.

She had ensnared the wrong meal - this was the girl.







Shit.









The Black Queen then hurried quickly out of the room, down the tower, and then into the opposite tower.  Rather annoyed at this point, she blasted through the door, though the sleeping boy did not stir.  She mentally chastized herself as she yet again set to work - It's the boy who wears the ridiculous ocular obscurers, not the other one! Duh! However, she did not spend much time on self-flaggelation... at least not yet.  There was work to be done.  Her carapaced fingers clacking together wickedly, she slipped her hand inside Dave's purple pajama pants, pleasingly pressing and patiently pulling on pre-pubescent phallus.  Fortunately for her, Dave's sword was not yet broken, seeing as the game was yet to start.  Hell, no one had even prototyped yet!  But this set-up time was running out, and the Queen was going to get the most out of her body while it was still her own, and not subject to the ill-informed whims of 13-year-old humans.

Pulling Dave's pants farther down, the Black Queen continued to glide her smooth fingers up and down his length.  Though unconcious in this realm (and, indeed, the other), he still seemed to be enjoying the treatment in some way, and was soon fully erect.  The Black Queen grinned, licked her lips, and prepared to enjoy her meal.  Hovering her face above his stark member, she exhaled soft warm breath on the tip, and slowly, loving licked it.  The unconcious lad bucked his hips slightly upward in response.  Taking this as encouragement, the Queen slowly took him into her mouth, white flesh being swallowed up by shiny black carapace.  Soon the Black Queen's nose was nestled in Dave's phlourescent pink pubic phollicles.  She slowly rose her mouth back up his turgid cock, licking all the way, and then slammed her face back down, resting a startled snort from the boy.

Soon the Black Queen was bobbing her head eagerly up and down Dave's dick (deliciously and daintily), while her own fingers were nestled tight within her chessgina, which is like a vagina, but for chess people.  Attuned the beat and rhythm of the world, she could easily tell by the pulsing of his blood and the straining of his flesh that Dave's tinklewinkle was about ready to pop.  Grinning mischievously, the Queen picked up her pace to an almost suicidal pace, spittle and pre-cum flying through the air, her fingers pistoning in and out of her chessgina.  With one almighty buck of his hips, Dave came, fast and hard, as did the Queen at the exact same time.  Because that's apparantly some gog-damned rule in these kinds of fics.

 

Ahem.

 

Anyways, the Black Queen swallowed the first load, but then lifted her face off his manhood, and let his cum rain down on her smooth black carapace.  She then had to sit back on the purple floor and catch her breath for a moment.  Smiling, she pulled the young boy's pants back up, tucking his now rapidly deflating cock inside, and sauntered back to Derse, exhausted but sated.  She would miss these little meals when the game started.

". He’s focused, more so than Laxus has seen him in a long time.

‘More,’ he says rather than asks, seeming a little dazed but also hungry. Laxus still hasn’t pulled back, strangely transfixed by this intense, calm Natsu who’s somehow shifted closer to him without him noticing. He’s beginning to feel a slight drain on his magic, but he lets the younger Dragon Slayer continue eating without even thinking about it. But then Natsu stops and looks up at him. Wide black eyes, entirely too close. Pink hair is almost in his face.

‘Laxus, I want more.’ Natsu licks his lips, a devious grin spreading over them. He stands up on his toes, even now noticeably shorter than the guildmaster’s grandson, and kisses Laxus. Whatever he’d been expecting, this wasn’t it. Natsu kisses greedily and without restraint and he finds himself responding even as muted alarm bells go off in his head. He knows he should probably stop here, while he still has the presence of mind to do so, but this is one battle he doesn’t hate losing. Natsu is stubborn and all but makes the decision for him, pressing himself tightly against Laxus’ body and placing flaming hot lips over his. His magic is being drained vigorously but there’s plenty more where that came from and he stops holding back.

Oi, oi, oi..he thinks to himself. When the hell did Natsu get this good at kissing? There was tongue, slipping expertly between his lips and teeth, not being denied entrance, taste unearthly and unlike anything Laxus has ever known. He had been eating fire and lightning merely seconds ago and it’s still crackling on his tongue a little.

Now he’s getting fired up too. He’s letting his magic pour out freely; he’s kissing Natsu back, but better. He’s not going to just stand there like a loser, he’s not afraid to take action. He’d cooled off lately, his temper reined in by the guild and life experience, but his stubborn and feisty attitude flares up again. He straightens up, towering over the younger Dragon Slayer. Natsu stills, eyes wide and wild, a little startled. There is a pause and each of them has a chance to catch their breath. Laxus grabs him, large hands easily grasping his shoulders and places him against the wall. He thinks Natsu’s legs might have given way because he wobbles a little, his hair sticking up in odd directions and his lips are red and swollen. He looks overwhelmed and absolutely delectable.

“Changed your mind?” he challenges, but Natsu is already grinning back at him.

“You wish!” he reaches forward and pulls Laxus in by the shirt. There is fire and electricity around them and they’ll probably break everything within reach but somehow Laxus finds he doesn’t particularly care. His gramps can complain all he wants about them wrecking the rebuilt Guild hall later, but now his priority is getting his hands all over Natsu’s well-toned body and everything else can go to hell.

The younger Dragon Slayer seems just as eager because he’s begun eating Laxus’ lightning magic again, shuddering with excitement. He rips off Laxus’ shirt, grabbing a fistful of the dark material and pulling hard. Not to be outdone, Laxus peels off the scarf and the jacket off him with little preamble, fingers glancing over the Fairy Tail mark on his right shoulder briefly. 

Natsu’s body is covered with a surprising number of scars and burns for someone with both amazing recuperative powers and a virtual immunity to fire. It’s a reminder of all the battles he’s fought and won and of every bit of strength hiding in his body that he’s worked so hard for and damn, it makes Laxus want him that much more.

He wants to completely overwhelm Natsu, wants to show him a taste of magic more intense than anything he could have imagined. He lets the greedy Salamander consume everything, till the last drop. Natsu’s eyes roll back in pleasure and a distinct moan escapes him.

‘…Fuck,’ Laxus hears himself saying. He’s really feeling the drain now, but it’s worth the effort, he thinks, when he sees Natsu’s eyes glazed over with pleasure, shivering in his grasp and arch back as much as the narrow space allows. He looks completely out of it.

‘Wanna stop?’ it pains him to ask, because he’s horny as fuck.

‘Tch. Don’t underestimate me,’ Natsu bites him, but at the same time his legs give up and he’s left practically pinned to the wall by Laxus’ strength alone. He’s fumbling with the zipper of Laxus’ trousers then and doesn’t waste time, stroking his hard length with a grin on his face.

His hand makes a visible dent in the wall where his fingers dig into it with the effort of holding them both up, but Laxus barely registers it. Natsu’s fingers aren’",candidate00010
"another day.

 

The plan for the trip consisted of the teachers taking the entire class of about 20 kids camping in the nearby woods, some minor survival training and team exercises. It was nothing too complicated and there was virtually no danger to them in the forest, but to the aspiring little ninjas this was incredibly exciting.

‘I wonder if I brought enough snacks,’ Chouji wondered aloud, while they stood around in front of the school.

‘I’ve got tons of ramen, I’ll share with you!’ Naruto grinned at his friend.

‘I just hope it doesn’t rain, I want to get some sleep…’ Shikamaru yawned. Someone bumped into him, but he was too tired to bother turning around to see who it was. Whatever.

‘Is everyone ready?’ Iruka-sensei called out, gathering everyone’s attention. ‘We’re leaving in five minutes so make sure you haven’t left anything behind!’

‘What a drag..’

‘Ehh? Where’s my bag?’ Naruto blinked confusedly. He was sure it had been sitting right behind him!

‘Did you forget it at home?’ Chouji munched on a chip.

‘He had it with him when he arrived… obviously someone took it,’ Shikamaru cringed. Naruto was already running off.

‘I’m gonna go look for it! Don’t leave without me, dattebayo!’ the blonde dashed back to the Academy.

He noticed it on the teacher’s desk in their usual classroom.

‘Huh? It’s just sitting there?’ He ran up to grab it (not before making sure all the ramen was still there). He’d only just picked it up when the door to the room slammed shut and locked with an audible click.

‘What? Hey, I’m still in here!’ Let me out!’ Naruto cried, running up the door just in time to ear an ominous giggling fading into the distance.

 

Ami and her gang must have finally got bored of picking on Sakura… Naruto clenched his fists. She’d left him alone this long, so why now! He threw the bag back down on the floor in frustration. It was no use, Ami was mean just because she loved being mean, there was never anything else to it. She’d always been a bully, even before they started school.

 

‘I bet they’ve finished roll call now,’ he ran to the window, looking down at the courtyard. There was no one left there. He was going to miss the trip! Even more importantly, he was trapped in the classroom.

The door was definitely locked tight and wouldn't even budge when he pushed it. Even when he eventually managed to climb up on the window sill, he couldn’t reach the handle to open the window. What felt like hours passed, while Naruto stared hopelessly out of the window. No one was even coming by to help, he was going to stay in this empty room forever. He didn’t even notice when he’d started crying until he suddenly couldn’t calm down at all.

‘Help! Someone!’ he involuntarily hiccuped. His nose was running now too. ‘Help!’

The door flew off it’s hinges, startling him into silence.

‘Thought I heard some crying brat making a racket.’ Hidan waltzed in, arms crossed and a displeased scowl on his face. ‘Thought I’d stop by to have a word with the teach about the nonsense they tea- ugh whatever. Why are you in here?’

‘I wasn’t crying,’ Naruto said quickly and wiped the tears and snot from his face with the end of his sleeve. Hidan’s eye twitched.

‘Uh-huh.’

‘I just..forgot my bag in here..dattebayo’ Naruto trailed off, unsure how to explain everything. ‘Ami was just being mean as always..’

‘I think I see where this is going.’ Hidan could just sacrifice the little bitch to Jashin - problem solved - but this did seem a little heavy-handed, all things considered. He was supposed to be on a secret mission or whatever. Pein came up with some shitty plans.

‘You should prank the hell out of her later,’ he shrugged.

Naruto grinned, even though his face was still puffy from crying. But the happy expression vanished just as quickly as it appeared.

‘I’ve missed the trip.. They went on without me,’ he confessed to Hidan, looking at his feet.

‘What are you talking about?’ Shikamaru’s voice rang out and the boy peeked into the room. ‘Sensei’s downstairs, looking for you while everyone waits inside. It started raining.’ The young Nara then turned around. ‘I found him!’ he yelled down the hall and someone shouted an acknowledgement back. Seconds later Chouji appeared in the doorway too.

‘Are you okay Naruto?’ he asked with concern.

Naruto wiped the last of the dampness of his face and nodded vigorously.

‘Let’s hurry up and go, dattebayo!’ he exclaimed.

"was significant. He couldn’t keep this up, against the strange Mokuton wielding plant man of unknown origin. This wasn’t like anything he’d ever fought before, but Kakashi wasn’t an elite of the elite for nothing. Using his left hand to throw out an explosive note, he created some distance between himself and his opponent by going out of the door quickly and then whistled. Before the smoke cleared, his nin-dogs, minus Pakkun and Bull collected in front of him.

“Hold him down for me if you get a chance,” he panted and the pack barked back its’ agreement, launching into attack formation at once. Vines and smoke shot out of the suddenly breached wall, but his dogs dodged them, advancing on the creature. Kakashi took out a kunai with his working hand and channelled lighting chakra through it, before throwing it into the fray. He heard an impact and the vines fell limp onto the scorched and crumbling floor.

“Now!” he commanded his dogs and they gripped onto each of the plan-man’s limbs.

“Just one more...” Kakashi thought, gathering chakra in his left hand this time. His vision was beginning to go blurry, from the continued use of the Sharingan, lightning chakra and the Raikiri. He jumped forward, stabbing the creature once more. It finally stilled and crumpled to the floor lifelessly. The Copy Ninja let out a shaking breath and checked for a pulse. There was nothing, so he covered his Sharingan and turned away, to find his students as fast as possible. If only he had stayed, he would have seen the strange man split in two, the dead white half collapsing in on itself. The black half then devoured it, to every last hair, before beginning to rise up again. Another white creature appeared out of the wall, then another and another. One approached the black half and they merged together, their flesh fusing and transforming anew.

*

Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke were stopped in their tracks by three strange white creatures. Immediately getting in their fighting stances, the Genin were trying their best to keep calm in their first real fight. These were the enemies that had taken down a squad of Chuunin. Sakura’s knees were shaking, but she straightened up, a determined expression on her face.

The three white figures moved towards them, their movements fluid. Naruto breathed in, trying to steady himself, not to rush in, when Sasuke made the choice for him and shot forward, attacking the closest creature with several kunai, which it dodged and extended it’s arm, getting a hold of the Uchiha’s sleeve. Before Naruto could process what was happening, an exact copy of Sasuke stood before them and formed the handseals for Gokakyuu no Jutsu. The three Genin dodged frantically, barely escaping the blazing fireball.

“Don’t let them touch you,” Sasuke grunted, getting to his feet in a defensive stance in front of his cone.

“No shit,” Naruto snorted, jumping up like a spring, just out of the reach of another one of the strange white creatures. Beside him, Sakura almost got caught but managed to chop off her assailant’s arm with a decisive slash of her kunai. Panting heavily, she fell to the ground, her breath shaky and quick.

Naruto needed to create distance between himself and the strange creature, but the only jutsu that might have been useful there that he knew required a water source. If only he could conjure enough water from the air… but that wasn’t an option now. Instead, he tossed half of all the kunai he had in quick progression, just to keep the creatures away. Sasuke was engaged in a taijutsu battle with his doppelganger, not paying much attention to his teammates.

“L-looks like it has all the same abilities as Sasuke-kun!” Sakura exclaimed still somewhat shaken, but more attentive now. Kakashi’s hellish training had paid off after all.

“So… they copy you by touch? We can’t let them get to us. Sakura, do you know any jutsu?” Naruto tried to think frantically, but with the blood pumping loudly in his ears and trying to watch their enemies’ movements, he couldn’t quite concentrate. Calm down, he told himself, but it didn’t really work. Sakura threw a few of her own shuriken in, protecting Naruto just in time.

“We need to take down the Sasuke-clone! Then he can help us with the other two,” the blond said, back to back with Sakura now, both on the defensive. The white creatures were now recovering from their attack and were about to run towards them again.

“Kawarimi with Sasuke,” Sakura told him then, her eyes suddenly bright with determination.

“Are you out of your MIND? That’ll never work, 'tebayo!” Naruto panicked, pushing her sideways to avoid one of the creature’s arm that had shot towards them. “It’s really not that sort of jutsu!”

“Just DO It,” the girl commanded, throwing the rock she’",candidate00010
"had been so wrong.

Nothing in his mind fitted together anymore. The memories with jagged edges were slowly making a sharp crack in his new life, threatening to flood over and ruin everything. He had tried so hard to make Daphne’s dream marriage come true, but he did not know if he could do so any longer. Sleep sneaked up on him swiftly and he greeted it eagerly, wishing to just forget for a couple of hours. When he awoke again, he knew what he had to do.

Cooking had never been his forte, but he was a quick learner and the recipe was not that difficult. His hands appeared to remember it well enough, familiar with the motions he could not recall consciously. Extra cinnamon, he knew just how to make it. When Daphne arrived, the lovely scent had filled the house and was escaping out of the kitchen window. It smelled delicious, he thought with a smile on his face. It was perfect.

When Daphne returned, he was just cleaning up the flour off the counter.

“Emmanuel?” The name felt like a sharp blow, deflating his eagerness at once. “What are you cooking?”

Daphne entered the kitchen, her face scrunched up oddly. She seemed out of place, he thought, his mind reeling. This was not how it was supposed to be. It wasn’t right.

“Apple pie,” he announced with a smile sneaking onto his lips. “It’s your favourite.”

Daphne covered her mouth with her hand, eyes narrowing. He felt his heart drop heavy as lead.

“I hate apple pie. I hate anything with cinnamon in it.”

He took a step back, feeling so separated from her reality; it was like watching the actions unfold automatically on a film.

“No. You must.” He felt his throat constrict, suddenly dry. “I know the person I love likes apple pie. I love you, don’t I?”

The words felt so foreign on his tongue; toxic and twisting his insides uncomfortably. The deafening silence in the wake of Daphne’s lack of response was like a hurricane just waiting to strike. He felt so small, ready to crumble under the force of it. He looked to her for any support, but the kind, selfless woman who helped him out of the lake was gone, closed off behind a cold wall. He could see the thoughts swirling behind her eyes – the loss, the disappointment. He reached out for her uncertainly, but she was already running up the stairs, too distraught to face him.

He stood there in silence for what seemed like a small eternity, letting the lonely silence gently rip him apart.

 



❖

 After he finally regained some control of himself, wiping half-dried tears from his face, he’d slouched in the couch, comforted by the darkness of the living room and the scent of cinnamon and freshly baked pie. It felt a little like home.

When Daphne left for work the next morning, it came as a wave of relief to him. He did not know how to face her. She was not who he had thought she was. So many mistakes had been made, layered one on top of the other… there was no way of fixing it all so easily. He slipped the wedding band off his finger, placing it on the mantelpiece. It was meaningless. They never consummated the marriage and now, he was surer than ever that he did not want to. He had felt obliged to try, for Daphne… but it just brought pain to them both.

He could still hear Daphne walking down the steps outside, talking to someone. A man. There was an inexplicable surge of hope in him, like a great fire had been lit in the darkness of his soul. He rushed to the door, opening it just as the stranger was about to knock.

“Cas?”

The green-eyed man stared at him with wide eyes. As if he’d seen a ghost.

The stranger was taller than him, dressed in loose jeans and a black jacket. His skin was healthily tan, as on someone who spent a lot of time outside. He had a bit of stubble, short hair… and was now on the verge of tears, blinking them back quickly when his lips stretched, showing the most breathtaking smile he had ever seen. All words of denial escaped him at once and he could feel himself smiling back too.

“Cas.” The man hugged him with so much force he was almost knocked back. He threw both arms around him, squeezing tightly. “Oh, fuck, Cas, I knew you couldn’t be dead,” the man choked out the broken words into his shoulders, shuddering with deep breaths of relief.

He didn’t know what to do, under such an intense… attack. His whole body hummed with pleasure in the embrace, fitting right up against the stranger like it belonged there. This man knew him.

He felt heat rise low in his belly, uncoiling something long forgotten. He trembled, closing his eyes as the overwhelming emotions washed over his body.",candidate00010
"left. His vision is swimming and dark, just barely good enough to see the pale, weak Angel writhing in pain beneath him.

“Gabe,” he tries to say, but nothing comes out of his mouth and he feels like someone has gripped his voice box and yanked it right out of him. “Gabriel,” he manages to squeeze out after all, forcing himself. The former Trickster gropes around blindly for Sam’s hand, seeking reassurance.

“Hey Sasquatch,” he grinds out somewhere between the gurgling of blood in his throat.

Sam wants to take Gabe and run, to save them even at the cost of the world burning up in Lucifer’s misguided wrath, but it’s too late – the fallen angel is already so close, wielding a sword of flame and darkness. He’s ready to make his move, but Sam has no intention of going with his plan. There would be no final, massive showdown. He just wants to save Gabriel.

“Oh, brother.” Lucifer’s mouth twists up in a wicked attempt at a smile. “Not you too,” he practically whines, dropping his arms down in mock defeat. “Another one gone over a human,” he shakes his head in disappointed. “Did the burning of infant Nephilim teach you nothing?”

“Fuck you,” Sam spits out, looking him directly in the eyes. He may be the fucking Devil, but he’s standing between a Winchester and his Angel, which you should never ever want to do.  

“Sam,” Gabriel calls hoarsely, his fists balled in the younger Hunter’s jacket. “Don’t.”

He’s practically begging.

“You should listen to him, you know,” Lucifer giggles gleefully. “You don’t stand the ghost of a chance.” He’s entirely too pleased with his own joke for Sam’s liking and he’s ready to punch the bastard if he has to resort to that.

But Gabriel’s hand tightens around his wrist and he feels a tug on it. It’s the sign they’ve used before, a signal for Sam to close his eyes – usually in a much safer and intimate situation, but he obeys anyway. He doesn’t even think about it, he just does it. He trusts Gabriel, though he’s worried. Whatever the Angel is going to do, Sam doesn’t like the possibility of.

“Hey Sam,” Gabriel’s hand is on his cheek; trembling. Sam blindly puts his own over it, feeling the fading warmth of his Angel’s body. He chokes back unintelligible words which are bubbling up in his chest.

“I think I might be falling for you.” Sam feels, rather than seeing, the wide grin on the former Trickster’s face. He can’t stop his closed eyes  from watering. Lucifer, surprisingly, doesn’t mock him for crying at the scene of the final battle, in fact he’s silently watching them. Uncomprehending.

“Gabe, I-,” Sam starts, but then he feels the last of the warmth in his Angel’s hands seep away and he’s thrown backwards. Even his firmly closed eyelids flash with brightness and he thinks he can hear Lucifer scream. Or maybe it’s him, still pulling at the empty space where Gabriel had been merely a fraction of a second before.

When he finally opens his eyes, he notices he’s in a giant, smoking crater. Lucifer is not far off, swaying on his feet. He might be saying something in a language Sam has never heard of, but doesn’t care to learn of at the moment, because he’d rather chop off the Devil’s head with one clean sweep of his own sword. Which is exactly what he does, pushing all his frustration, confusion and anger into one thrust. He doesn’t hesitate and suddenly, it’s over.

He’s just barely holding himself together; his whole body is wrecked by deep, sharp sobs and he just can’t stop the tears from flowing now. He’s somehow survived the blast of Grace which burned the ground for miles around, but Gabriel – his Angel, his everything, has vanished from existence without a trace. The Archangel had sacrificed himself for them again.

❖

Three months after the defeat of Lucifer, Sam still misses Gabe so much he’s ready to rip his own heart out and join him in Heaven, despite how strongly he hates almost everybody else up there. He won’t though, because deep down, he knows they will meet again. Yeah, Gabriel had a little red on his ledger and some bad history with the big guys back in Heaven, but he was an Archangel who had prevented the Apocalypse. There was no way they wouldn’t let him in. Or so he reasons with himself, against everything the Universe keeps throwing at him. As long as there is that little sliver of hope that the former Trickster’s Grace survived and made it back, that one day he’d find Gabriel waiting",candidate00010
"“I wonder if Kuromaru is actually a boy or a girl,” Ikkuu says thoughtfully, making Kirie scowl.

“Does it matter?” she folds her arms across her chest.

“Not really.”

“Then why’d you bring it up!” Kirie is annoyed, as she always is these days. Touta Konoe is a strange existence indeed, stirring the whole Holder into complete disarray with his mere presence.

“Want to go see how their training is going?” he smiles and the scowl she sends his way would be enough to make any other man back off, but he’s pretty used to it by now.

“I don’t care how that… incompetent is doing,” she turns her nose up. “Besides, it’ll probably be dangerous. I don’t feel like dying today.”

“Hai, hai,” he says lightly and returns to the book he’s been reading. After a few minutes of silence, he can literally feel Kirie vibrating with annoyance without even looking in her direction. Teasing her never gets boring.

“I’m going for a walk!” she gets up and stops off, not for a second fooling him. She’s going to spy on Touta and Kuromaru, it’s been her favourite pastime as of late. He follows her a moment later.

They’re in their usual training spot, behind the hot springs where it’s usually safe enough to go all out without hurting anyone or destroying too much. No one wants to get on Makabe-senpai’s bad side after all. The two youngest immortals in their ranks are fighting with enthusiasm, though a brawl with their bare fists might be a better description of this ‘training’. They’re practically rolling around in the dirt, but there are smiles on both their faces.

“What are you doing here,” Kirie hisses at him from her hiding spot. They haven’t noticed him yet and she drags him into the bushes with a surprising amount of strength. His mechanic body isn’t exactly light.

“I’m sure they’d let you watch or join in if you asked,” Ikkuu says, making himself comfortable. Kirie goes red on the face.

“S-shut up, it’s not like that.”

“Hm.”

Kirie punches him, but quickly withdraws her hand, wincing in pain. “Idiot cyborg,” she complains.

“Is that all you’ve got, Kuromaru?!” Touta shouts and all of a sudden he’s kicking up a sandstorm, using shunpo as a makeshift attack. The ex-immortal hunter produces a sword from nowhere and slices through the incoming hail of sand and stones with ease.

“Looks like they’re getting serious,” Ikkuu smiles. His sensors are picking up a rush of ki being released. Beside him, Kirie’s face lights up in excitement; only because she doesn’t know he’s watching.

Then something obviously goes wrong, because there’s an explosion and before he can really process what is happening, he finds himself curled over Kirie, defensive shield activating just before the visual feed from his eyes cuts out and his internal systems shut down.

When his backup power activates seconds later, he’s being rushed back to the mansion. Touta and Kuromaru are carrying him, both covered head to toe in dirt, blood and oil. The sound is cutting out, some of the microphones in his ears must be damaged. Kirie is saying something frantically, her face pale. She’s holding what appears to be his detached arm, wires torn and tangled.

“I … save point … stupid,” she’s obviously angry but marches on beside him. Then she visibly sighs, her face relaxing a little. She leads them to one of his usual mechanics, where Touta unceremoniously dumps his broken body. His vocal output isn’t working either, so he sits there quietly while he’s being slowly put together. Kirie seems to have calmed down. She’s glancing at him every other minute, alternatively worried and annoyed. It’d be almost cute, if he wasn’t certain she’d kill him and bring him back to life just to show him how stupid he’s being.

When he’s finally restored to somewhat working condition, it’s quite late and she’s fallen asleep leaning against one of the assembly machines. She’s grabbing onto his hand in a way that isn’t at all romantic, it would probably be rather painful if he was able to feel it.

“Just in case I need to reset,” she mumbles in her sleep.

"pedal. He was going to go straight home and take a bath - that would soothe his aching muscles.

It was getting dark and somewhat chilly. He should have brought a jacket, he concluded. His freely wandering thoughts were interrupted by an unusual sight in the distance.

Something was approaching from the opposite direction and he had to squint to see in the shadowed figure struggling uphill. It was a familiar mess of green hair. Makishima…?

He was climbing.

Swaying from side to side dangerously, Makishima danced gracefully. The closer they got to each other, the clearer it became that the green haired boy was exhausted. His hands were clutching the handlebars desperately and his face was drenched with sweat. He didn’t seem to recognize Tadokoro, completely focused on his lone struggle against the hellish hill towards the school.

‘Makishima!’ he called out. ‘Makishima!’

His friend just kept going, but his pace slowed considerably. He was crawling upwards, his legs practically groaning under the strain. He passed Tadokoro, but it was doubtful he could make it all the way to the top in this state.

‘Makishima!’ he called out again, this time turning around to catch up with him. The green head turned slowly towards him.

‘Tadokoro?’ he ground out, his breath ragged and hoarse. ‘What are you doing here…?’

‘I should be asking you that. What are you thinking, pushing yourself so hard right after practice? You look like shit.’

They came to a stop and Makishima wobbled feebly on the spot. He was completely exhausted.

‘I have to perfect this,’ his grip on the handlebars tightened. ‘There’s not enough time…’

‘Wearing yourself out isn’t going to miraculously achieve anything overnight,’ Tadokoro said firmly, placing a hand on his friend’s bony shoulder. ‘Have you even eaten?’

Makishima blinked stupidly at him. Obviously he hadn’t.

‘We’re going for food then you’re going home to rest, alright?’ Tadokoro wasn’t going to take a no for an answer. Makishima looked like he wanted to argue, but lacked the energy to do so. He seemed to visibly deflate even as they rode downhill.

Tadokoro didn’t know what to say. He knew that everyone on the team worked harder than ever now, trying to bring their own abilities to a higher level. But exhausting yourself to the point of injury would only be counterproductive. If Makishima couldn’t ride with them…

‘You’re making a scary face, Tadokoro,’ his friend laughed weakly. ‘What’s up?’

Tadokoro shrugged. An awkward silence seemed to hang between them all the way until they settled in at the nearest family restaurant. The menu wasn’t the most impressive, so he decided to just order everything.

Makishima stared, bewildered as plates piled in front of him. He only managed a salad in the same time as Tadokoro had already inhaled chicken nuggets, a wrap, fries, beans, a tub of ice cream and several other items.

‘You going to finish that?’ he asked Makishima, pointing vaguely at the burger from the set he’d ordered. Makishima handed the plate over mutely.

After a moment he said, ‘How do you manage to eat so much?’ and scrunched up his nose, confused. It was quite a cute look.

‘It’s good. And I burn off all unnecessary calories in practice. If my body mass changed suddenly, I’d lose the strength I use for sprinting.. so I need to balance exercise and the food I eat throughout the day.’ It wasn’t the first time he’d had to explain his eating habits to curious people. Everyone wanted him to diet and lose weight, but his body mass was not only something he worked hard to maintain, it was his unique weapon in road racing. ‘You need a tough body to match your resolve to win.’

‘That’s unexpectedly thoughtful,’ Makishima laughed. He helped himself to a few more fries.

‘I guess I was a bit impatient… Toudou’s been egging me on,’ he showed Tadokoro his phone, flooded with text messages from the other climber. There were a lot of emojis and most of it made virtually no sense. He couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Makishima eventually caved in and began laughing too, holding his sides.

‘Feel better?’ Tadokoro asked after they quieted down again.

‘Yeah,’ Makishima smiled widely. It was a rare sight and something in Tadokoro’s stomach began to feel ticklish and restless. It probably wasn’t because of all the food. ‘Thanks, man.’

Yuusuke got up to leave and Tadokoro glared at him reproachfully.

‘What..?’ the green haired boy swallowed thickly, apprehensive.

‘Take care of yourself. It’s important for the team,’ Tadokoro got up too and punched Makishima on the arm, grinning. ‘We’ll be counting on you!’

Yuusuke nodded, while patting his arm absentmindedly, not really bothered that it would probably form a bruise later.

‘We can get food",candidate00010
"John sighs, leaning his back against the wall, close to the corner of the room so as to avoid as much attention as is humanly possible, while still being able to keep an eye on Sherlock so he’ll know just when he gets sick of mouthing niceties and starts telling truths.

It’s one of those dreary, horrifically monotonous dinner parties that Sherlock, and by extension, John, always gets invited to; by which John means that Sherlock is invited and, in an attempt to outrage as many conservative rich bigots as possible, drags John along as his date, touching him more than often and violating his personal space in ways that would have discomfited him six months ago (and John isn’t sure what to think of them now, but-)

“How’s the party, John?” Sherlock whispers in his ear, soft and caressing.

Without looking, John turns slightly and punches Sherlock in the stomach; not hard, but enough to elicit a wince of pain and a muttered gasp of “that was really quite unnecessary.”

“So was sneaking up on me for the millionth time, you moron,” John replies flatly, settling back against the relative comfort of his wall.  “What do you want?”

No response, which isn’t really surprising.

What is surprising is that, when John glances across, Sherlock isn’t there anymore; normally when he comes to bother John at functions like this, he’s more persistent than this.

“I’m not going to go look for him,” John tells himself.

He lasts all of about five minutes.

“Fondue.”

“Yes John, oddly enough I noticed,” Sherlock says sharply – or at least, he tries to say sharply, around the chocolate-dipped strawberry shoved with little grace into his mouth.

“Fondue.”

Sherlock glares at him as he chews.

He shakes his head, but the confusion doesn’t seem to be clearing up.  “I’m sorry, you – you wanted to tell me about fondue?”

It comes out a little more incredulous than he’d intended; and sure enough, Sherlock pushes off the wall to straighten to his full height, raising his chin in a far-too familiar look of offended disdain. 

Somehow, John finds himself looking up – not to meet Sherlock’s eyes, but at juice-stained lips. 

“If you-“

John, who’d had to sit through a good hour of Mycroft not-so-subtly threatening him with…something…if he let Sherlock make a scene, already knows where this is going and decides to cut him off as soon as possible.

“No no no,” he says hastily, raising his hands in what is probably far too defensive a gesture.  “I like fondue.  Fondue is good.  I haven’t seen fondue in years.” To emphasise his point he reaches for a strawberry, trying not to turn away from Sherlock as he dips it in chocolate and brings it to his mouth.

John had meant the motion to be a distraction; to pull Sherlock away from whatever ground of righteous annoyance he felt he was entitled to.

But it has been a while since John has had strawberries, and an even longer while since he’s had chocolate (not the crappy one pound chocolate from the store down the street but real, amazing chocolate) and without intending to he finds his eyes fluttering closed as he savours the meld of sweetness and rich, tangy juice in his mouth.

At some point he comes back down to Earth with a jolt of realisation; his eyes snap open and his lips part, because he can feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, dark and strangely intense, the usual grey swirled through with flecks of violet.

“I.  Um.”  He has to say something.  “I thought you weren’t into the whole eating thing.  For fun,” he adds because in all fairness, Sherlock eats.  Sometimes not at all, sometimes all day (and night) but it does happen.  Actually, if someone were bother to average out Sherlock’s eating habits over the past year, John actually thinks it might look like something vaguely resembling normal.

Sherlock doesn’t reply, just stares at him.  Self-consciously, John bites his lip and tastes chocolate (probably what Sherlock’s staring at, the judgemental bastard.)  Without really thinking about what he’s doing, John lets his tongue dart out to lick at the remnants.

When it’s gone, John refocusses on Sherlock – whose eyes flicker away from his mouth just a little too late.  Something flickers in his stomach, unsettling but strangely pleasant, and he can’t help but smile as a slight flush rises in his roommate’s pale cheeks.

“…Sherlock?  Sherlock, are- where are you going?”

“Home.  I’m bored,” Sherlock says loudly, not even bothering to turn around to look at John as people send reproachful glances in his direction.  “Are you coming or not?”

John laughs quietly as he follows.",candidate00011
"You come reluctantly to meet her, because do not fear war but the ocean is strange to you, and Westeros as far as the stars.  An army for a woman.

A fool would accept and so, Khal Drogo or not, you must be a fool.

Perhaps it is her innocence that draws you to her; she is young but not too young, older than some of the women in your khalasar who have already begun to service men.  If she were born Dothraki, she would be no different.

But if she were born Dothraki, she would not look as she does, pale and soft with long hair that shines like the centre of the sun, white and blinding.  You cannot help but look at her, touch her hair; she is foreign, fragile.

You feel her tears against the calluses on your hands and you fuck her harder.

 

~~~~~

 

Every time you enter her, you can’t believe it could feel any better; her body writhing as it is impaled by yours, her smooth white skin a complete opposite to your darkness, your war-torn hands and chest.

The first time she comes to you willingly, faces you as she pushes down on your cock and does not cry, you prove yourself wrong.

No – she proves you wrong, your tiny fragile delicate with iron in her bones and fire in her veins.

 

~~~~~

 

You know that she is the dragon her brother (that disgusting, scheming rat whose neck you would break in an instant if you did not know she still loves him) can never be, when she coughs, almost gags, and yet forces the rest of the heart into her tiny mouth.

Blood drips from her mouth, down her body.  Her lips are stained – and not just her lips, but the pale skin of her face.  Her eyes are wild, like those of an animal, burning fierce and crazed, and she could not speak a word now if she needed to –

She is beautiful.

And you promise her everything; her Iron Throne, her Seven Kingdoms, for she cannot deserve any less.  You promise and you know that you will not stop till you hand the world to her and your son.

 

~~~~~

 

It’s not a serious wound.

You cannot understand why she is concerned, why she calls the witch-woman to help you.

You are a warrior.

You are Khal Drogo.

And you are dying, the woman whispers to you.


No.


The Dark Stallion takes you quietly, its rider a not-man with an empty skull and soft, sonorous words that hum with kindness and rest (you are so weary, so tired, and your body means nothing because you cannot feel it and you are too busy watching her tears and hearing her screams to care-)

 

~~~~~

 

And just as your spirit is about to surrender, as all do, to the Great Stallion, a sense of wrongness sweeps you by and pulls you, as if by a metal rope, back-

But nothing connects, you are in your human flesh and you love her but this is too much.

End it, you order the witch-woman whore who killed your son (for you felt his spirit leave instead, quiet and confused and so young) for you to return like this.

She does not seem to hear the words you try to force from your unresponsive mouth, but smiles as though she hears you somewhere else, in the depths of her mind.

“And now you understand, Khal Drogo,” the witch whispers in your ear.

End it, you shout to Ser Jorah, the knight of Westeros.  End it and keep her safe (but do not touch her no man can touch her she is mine).

He frowns slightly, but then shrugs his shoulders in dismissal and you know  that no one can hear you.

But you try once more, because you must.

My love, you whisper as she weeps.  End it.

For half a day you think that she cannot hear you, that she does not understand.

But then you feel her mouth around your cock, you feel her try and you would give anything to show her but you can’t.

She is still crying as she pushes the pillow into your face and you love her more than ever.",candidate00011
"slightly, the sound pleasant and warm if a little strained.  Dean relaxes, glad that she’s not offended. She’s taken all of this incredibly well – only nodded and asked the barest of questions as Dean had talked, Sam jumping in occasionally with extra info, gaze intent and determined.  Since Sam left, they’ve been deviating slightly from the conversation topic – understandably, since with no new information apart from the confirmation that Mara/Leimara was lonely and missing home, there hasn’t been much to discuss – and Dean’s been discovering with no small amount of pleasure that Kate isn’t just easy on the eyes, she’s also intelligent and funny.

(And only about two and a half years younger than him, which is even better.)

Not that the first doesn’t tend to make up his mind most of the time, but the other two are brilliant, will take any girl from mildly attractive to extremely hot.

He’s suddenly aware that they’re sitting next to each other on the couch now, closer than is normally socially acceptable.  It’s not bothering him too much, and doesn’t seem to be bothering her.

“So-“ he begins, with some vague intention of suggesting – what exactly, he doesn’t know – and then his phone rings and they jerk apart, almost guiltily.  Kate pushes herself to her feet, muttering something about grabbing some biscuits, and Dean reaches into his pocket.

It’s Sam, of course, the always-dependable cock-blocker.

“What?” he asks brusquely into the phone in lieu of actually saying hello.

“I know what they are,” Sam says breathlessly, and then hangs up.

Dean stares at his phone, blinks slowly.  “Wow.  What a bitch.”  He shakes his head wonderingly then looks over to Kate.  “It was Sammy- Sam,” he corrects hastily, because as much as he’ll call Sam Sammy when they’re alone, it feels strange using that name in public.  Like revealing a secret about someone, except that the secret’s one of yours too.  “He says he knows what it is.  Didn’t say anything else, but at least one of us knows.   Good old Sam.”  He can’t help but smile fondly, because it’s true.

There’s a heavy sigh from the kitchen, and Dean looks up.  “I knew it,” Kate groans.  “the good ones are always taken or gay.  Or both.”   She shakes her head.  “I just don’t know why you guys felt like you needed to pretend to be brothers – I’m an actress, after all, it’d be pretty depressing if I was homophobic.”

It takes Dean a while to work that out.

“What- what, wait no, no, no,” he repeats, aghast.  “Sam’s my brother, we’re not, I mean, that’s…”

He trails off, suddenly uncomfortably aware that he’s not sure what that is.  He knows what should be leaping to mind, what he should be exclaiming (disgusting, wrong, perverted, incest) and for Sammy they’d be true.

Not for him.

(But he promised after Stanford happened never to think about it, never again.)

Dean glances at Kate again and realises with a start that she’s been watching him closely, frown of concentrating indicating that (much to his dismay) she’s been taking everything in.

“I believe you,” she says finally.  “But…you shouldn’t be so hard on yourself.”

“What do you mean?” Dean asks flatly.

With a roll of her eyes, she shifts her weight to rest her hand on her hip.  “I mean seriously, Dean, it’s pretty obvious that you’re really into him.  In a really not-platonic way.  And that he feels exactly the same.  You guys are meant to be.”

“No, I don- I’m sorry, what?”

“And I know the whole taboo thing sucks but you hunt supernatural things and have a criminal record, right?  You shouldn’t worry so much about it,” Kate continues over him like he didn’t say anything, stepping back towards the couch to pat his shoulder comfortingly before moving towards the kitchen again.

“I-“

The front door bursts open and Sam rushes in.  “I think we have a problem,” he huffs breathlessly, collapsing to his knees and barely managing to kick the door closed before something bangs on it, loud and insistent.

“Caiinell,” Sam explains around a mouthful of water.  The banging hasn’t stopped, though they’ve shoved everything in front of the door in an effort to provide as much protection as possible.  “They’re offspring of Cain-“

“Wait,” Dean interrupts, “as in Cain and Abel Cain?”

A beady glare from Sam doesn’t make Dean feel anything other than amusement, but Kate’s reproachful glance causes him to flush.",candidate00011
"and a half.  Your-“

“Oh, for heaven’s sakes, can someone tell me whatever I’ve been missing?” he finally snaps, sick of all the bickering when he’s spent – really, two years? – being panicked and terrified and, perhaps worst of all, confused.

They all freeze at his outburst, and when they move it’s to fidget awkwardly, with more than a little embarrassment.  Finally Ara sighs.  “Basically, the apocalypse.”

“…Sorry, what?”

“The last two years.  An apocalypse.  Zombie style.  That’s what’s been happening,” Lia says.

He nods slowly, piecing together everything he’s seen, every town he’s passed by and all the things that he’s been running from; the dead bodies he’s left behind, all of it.  “Okay,” he says, and then passes out.

 

~

 

In his defence, malnutrition is a perfectly valid reason to faint mid-conversation.

He’s more than aware of the fact that his ex-girlfriend and other female friend are going to hold this against him till the end of time.  They’re surprisingly light on the teasing, however, as they watch him shovel fruit and soup (apparently he’s not allowed to have any real food till his body’s used to metabolising that) as fast as he can.

“So what happened to you three?” he asks around mouthfuls of food.  “After you left Germany?” It comes out a little less coherent than that, and Ara’s nose wrinkles slightly in disgust, but she doesn’t say anything, glancing at Lia.

“Well, we pretty much did our whole travel thing, and we were here when we saw the news about Australia.  Just haven’t left, I suppose.”

“That was August 2016,” Raine adds.  “And then January last year, Lia picked up-“ She stops abruptly as Lia makes wild hand gestures – more than enough to pique his curiosity, but not strong enough against the seemingly endlessly ravenous hunger that’s still wracking his body.  “Um.  Yeah.  Anyway, a couple of months later in April, we managed to get back into the satellite networks, figured out who’s still alive-“

“Raine!” someone calls from the doorway in a heavily accented voice (European, North European, though that’s as good as his accent detection is right now).  “Call from London!”

“Coming!” she yells back, already pushing back her chair.  “Have fun with the whole apocalypse explanation thing,” she adds as an almost-afterthought to him, running out of the room.

“London?” he asks.

Ara shrugs.  “Meh,” is all she says.

Lia is more forthcoming – “Raine has a boyfriend,” she croons.  Ara raises an eyebrow at her, and for some reason she shuts right up with a subdued, “yeah.”

“So,” Ara continues, turning back to him and taking his now-empty plate – he didn’t notice – from the top of his blanket.  He wants more, but before he can even ask she shakes her head.  “Can’t eat too much,” she says, not unkindly.  “It’ll be the biggest waste when you throw it all back up again.”

Probably true.  Still, logic doesn’t stop his stomach from crying out for nourishment.

“Anyway,” Ara says.  “We’ve got Alice - from our NSG group – down in Antarctica.  They’ve got a full base of operations and practically untouched satellite control because it was way too cold for the zombie virus to even survive at all, let alone infect anyone.  Fiona – again, NSG group, don’t think you remember her – was up in the Blue Mountains till there was this whole tension thing with the zombie government in Australia-“

Zombie…government?”

“Oh yeah,” Lia jumps in, “they can like, think and everything.”

“Malcolm Turnbull’s Prime Minister,” Ara adds.  “Ate Tony Abbot in Parliament,” and he can’t help but scoff at the irony.

“So basically,” Lia says, “all the human peeps have been getting together – that’s how Raine met the London guy, Will, he’s like the Minister for Foreign Affairs or something-“

“Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs,” Ara mutters.

“- Whatever.  “And he totally got drunk and told her she was hot last Halloween,”

“Relevant, Lia.”

“- Dude, totally.  And then there was this summit, yeah, like in December, and just after that apparently he found out about this whole plan by NATO-“

“Which still exists,” Ara says drily, “despite the fact that like half the member states are zombie-controlled.”

Lia stops, crosses her arms (he remembers that from their relationship, as long as it’s been since then) and glares at Ara.  “Are you telling this or am I?”

“Fairly sure I was, but go ahead,” the taller girl says,",candidate00011
"from Hell.

“I do not answer to you, boy,” Castiel hisses, though her facial muscles remain still, unresponsive to her emotion in the same way Jimmy’s used to be, the first week Castiel spent in that body.  “The girl said yes.  I have every right to be here.”

The younger Winchester flinches away, but Dean throws back his shoulders, meets Castiel’s gaze.  “Come on, man,” he says, and even Castiel is able to discern the forcedness underpinning his casual tone, the tension running through her body.  “Do you really want to be stuck in a chick’s body?  I mean – dude, isn’t she a bit young for you?”

Words are on the tip of her tongue – I am utterly indifferent to gender, I feel no sexual attraction to any being, aged or not – but she bites them back because you are not like them, you are greater than them, they are hairless apes and you are the light of God.

She shakes her head.  “I don’t answer to you,” she repeats.  “Heaven has called Claire Novak to service, and she will serve.  As will you two.”

“But-“ And of course Dean pushes it, stubborn primate that he is.  If this were Jimmy Novak’s body Castiel would have reached out, shoved the human against the wall and shown him his place.  But Claire is small and slim, so instead Castiel splays out a hand, lets her power do the work for her as Dean struggles at the invisible hand pinning him against the dirty brick.

“Enough, Dean.”  From the way Sam claps his hands over his ears and winces, a bit of Castiel’s true voice must have bled through.


Control.  Control.


Dean’s staring at Castiel, no longer struggling against Castiel’s power.  “Please, Cas,” he whispers, cockiness suddenly dissipated.  “She’s just a kid.”

Angelic vessels do not tire, nor do the angels within them.  But a sudden weariness racks Castiel’s Grace, hits her with waves of draining fatigue till all she wants is to return to the Garden, to the peaceful, emotionless tranquillity of Heaven.  “I shall endeavour to find another vessel to hold me,” Castiel finally murmurs, child’s voice barely a wisp of noise in the suddenly quiet room.  “But Claire will hold me till then.”

An echo, please no, please, it hurts, but Castiel silences it with a flicker of thought as she brushes past Sam.

“Where are you going?”

Sam asks quietly.  Castiel doesn’t bother to turn as she responds.  “To do Heaven’s work.  Not yours.”


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

It’s all a flicker of hazy images and memories – like blurred photographs and badly-recorded videos of teenage birthdays – till Dean wakes Castiel up with two hands on her shoulder, trying to shake her till he realises she’s an angel, not a child, and turns away in disgust.

And no, that isn’t true.  Castiel is an angel of the Lord, a creature of the light.  She remembers everything with unrelenting clarity, till something unfamiliar and frightening in her aches with a pain Claire tentatively associates with nausea.

There’s Zachariah gloating as Sam goes crazy, intoxicated by the blood that the demon forces him to crave.

There’s Castiel and the smile, as warm as she can make it but touched by sadness all the same, as she opens the door and lets Sam out.

And then there’s Dean’s rage, palpable and burning (though slightly tempered with confusion whenever he looks in her direction.)

It’s (not) a flicker of hazy images and clear-cut memory till Castiel catches the suddenly sharpening intent in Dean’s mind to strike out at Castiel’s (Claire’s – no, she’s just a child, fricking meatsuit or not goddamnit) face.

That, more than the feeling of warm human skin against her bare shoulders, draws Castiel back into the realisation that this is happening.

That Dean has his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, is stooped over to meet her eyes with a desperately burning rage – and something else, a sort of despairing curiosity, as though he’s looking for something.


Please tell me you’re in there, Cas, c’mon dude, please-


Castiel vanishes in a panicked flutter of wings.  But Dean’s words linger on, teasing at her, and maybe they’re the reason that she ends up on a vast, wide beach on the north-east coast of Australia.  It’s twilight here, and heading into autumn, so the beach is largely deserted, and too dim for any of the humans on the beach to detect her.  Nevertheless, she draws the coat she’s wearing tighter around her –

"blood.

Anyway, she’s sort of off-topic so apparently there’s a thing going on between humans and zombies.

Ara doesn’t sound particularly happy about that, but Alyce isn’t sure whether that’s because she’s going to feel worse about slaughtering tons of them a day (Ara sounds sort of normal on the phone but she’s talked to Raine and Lia and apparently she’s anything but normal) or if it’s because Alice down in Antarctica didn’t tell her about the whole thing.

As far as Alyce knows, the deal works something along the lines of splitting the world in half.  Or ¾ or whatever works.  As far as deals go, she supposes it works.  It’s sort of depressing to realise that she wouldn’t ever be able to see those of her friends who didn’t get turned but then again, she has no idea who’s alive and who isn’t so it’s not too much of a loss.  She knows the cricket lover's somewhere in Germany, but everyone else was in either Australia or somewhere warm (i.e. zombie-fied) when the whole thing went down.

 

~

It’s a complete accident when she hears, day of cricket lover's birthday that they now use as a way to mourn the dead, mourn themselves, and watch Star Wars on repeat till they fall asleep.

She totally doesn’t mean to; she’s making a pit stop at one of the convenience stores that’s reopened for Oreos so she can make that cake she made once before for a Star Wars marathon too many years before.

“…And you don’t think that’s too bold?”

Alyce doesn’t know what makes her duck around the corner when she hears that voice.  Maybe it’s the fact that it’s cold, passionless, sort of like Palpatine but more boring, and therefore somehow much more evil.

A laugh, fake and humourless.  “Why does it matter? We know they’re planning on betraying the agreement, after all; we need to make the first move, and if that involves eradicating the last of the human presence” – he spits the word human as though he never was one – “then we will do it.”

Blue Mountains, Alyce thinks, and then shit.

She doesn’t understand why, but all she knows is that it’s happening.  That the unturned are going to trust and trust and then before they have time to swallow the betrayal they’ll be dead.

Like the Jedi children but not as fictional,

The phone rings five times and then goes to voicemail, with the same annoying chick that she swears every single phone company used for the same recording.  “Hey, um, this is Alyce-“ Alyce begins, only to be cut off by a loud beep.

“Your voice message is being transcribed and will be sent as a message.  Have a good day.”

Damn it.

Sighing, she scrolls aimlessly through her contacts, not really seeing any of the names – she tried, after all, that’s all she had to do, she can’t feel guilty now…

A name leaps out at her, glaring and obvious, like it’s suddenly branded into her brain or something.

Lia.

Ara’s friend in the Netherlands, she thinks.  The one with the satellite phone, whose number Alice gave her in case of emergencies, whatever that means.

Alyce doesn’t have to.  She knows she doesn’t have to; fricking hell, she’s not even human anymore, it’s not like she owes them, she tried to call Fio and nothing happened-

All it takes for evil to happen is for good men to do nothing.

“Gaaaah.”

It’s probably the whole zombie thing that leaves her empty hand trembling by her side as she presses Call, green and innocent when it should be red and flashing with Do Not Touch.

“Heello?  It’s Lia.” 

The voice is breathless, like the other person had to run to make the phone.  Alyce wonders idly in the midst of painful, knotting terror, whether that might have been better for everyone her.


And was it the whole zombie thing that made her this selfish, or was she always like this?


“Hello?”

She can just hang up.  She doesn’t have to do

 I have to tell you something, and it’s important,” Alyce’s mouth says.  Well, there goes that.

“Sorry, um, who is this?” 

“Alyce.  I’m one of Ara’s friends?”

“Ohh…the…”

She rolls her eyes.  “Yeah, the zombie.”

“Lia?  Who is it?”  It’s a guy’s voice, a guy who sounds vaguely familiar.  Her first thought is Loki, Avengers, hahaha, and then oh yeah, Fio said…and then eww, so that’s why she was",candidate00011

III.


So after Banner and Steve have both stopped blushing, and Clint has stopped weeping (you’re not sure if that’s from the shock of reliving his trauma or from the fact that said trauma’s now officially going to be the subject of Stark’s merciless mockery at least the next few days), you try for a shift in mood; or at least, for something doesn’t immediately fall under the category of embarrassing.

It’s hard, but you’ll have time to tell those stories later.

Afghanistan, 1987; and for the first time, you’re not paying attention to anyone else’s reaction.  Instead, you meet his eyes, knowing that he’s thinking the same thing you are.

(And this is beyond normal levels of drunk if you’re willingly D&Ming with Clint.)

(And of course you don’t tell the truth this time, because there are some things that Steve and Thor and Banner and even Stark, that unethical but terrifyingly moral prick, couldn’t understand.)

(But you think it, and you know he’s thinking it too.)

This is just after you’ve given up on the Soviet Union.

Unfortunately, the Soviet Union hasn’t given up on itself; and you’re forcing yourself to wait it out till that finally happens; so you’re in that lovely awkward position where the Soviet Union thinks you’re still totally into them, and the United States are positive you’re on the right side.

And clearly, neither of them know how to court a girl, and so instead of the gifts and flowers that you totally deserve in exchange for perhaps eventually deciding to swing in favour of one or the other, you find yourself placed in charge of defending Tohir Yo’ldosh, some obsequious sadistic toad of a local politician.

It works out fine for the first few months (you help the more respectable political prisoners escape at night, and he pretends not to notice because any protection is better than none).

(Of course, Clint has to come along to fuck it all up.)

“Agent Romanova, what do you think?” Yo’ldosh asks you in heavily accented Russian, smarmy smile twisting his lips.

You idiot, is what you’re thinking, staring at Clint as he leans heavily against the wall of the tiny interrogation room.  “He’s not going to speak,” you quietly respond.

The man chuckles, a horrible grating sound.  “Well,” he begins, “I am certain that-“

“I’ve encountered Agent Barton before,” you say quickly – too quickly, and you berate yourself briefly for it – “he’s not going to speak.”

But sadists are sadists, and it takes two hours of listening to Clint scream as you watch, impassive, before Yo’ldosh concedes defeat.

“I suppose you are right, Agent Romanova,” he sighs petulantly – in English, this time, even more horribly mangled than his Russian, and you know he wants Clint to hear him.

Somehow, through the blood and bruising and broken bones, Clint’s mouth curves in a smile, “Damn straight,” he rasps out, before biting straight through his lip when Yo’ldosh delivers a kick to his shattered left thigh.

“I truly wish it did not have to come to this,” the man says, false sincerity oozing from every pore.  He turns his head.  “Bring the girl in!” he shouts.

The girl is fourteen.  She’s bruised and bewildered.

She’s Yo’ldosh’s niece.

~~~~~

Alright so it turns out this puffed-up little ingrate is actually crazier than you thought; as in, he transcends sane crazy and makes it into genuine Freudian insanity with room to spare.

“Talk and we will let you go” (lie – you know very well that Yo’ldosh had already ordered the shallow grave for Clint’s body to be dug) “or do not talk…and I will get angry.” 

He shrugs.  “And perhaps you will be hurt” (some more) “or perhaps,” you see the girl (Fila, her name is) flinch from his touch, and that’s when you know he’s already raped her, “someone else will.  She is my sister’s child.  I would not like to see her dead, but there are things we must do for our country.”

You very carefully keep your expression blank.

But that’s another thing, like swimming, that he obviously never learned.

The politician sneers when Clint’s eyes widen.  “Ah yes, your American sense of justice.  I am appealing to your American sense of justice, Mr…what did you say his name was, Agent Romanova?”

“Barton,” you reply (not numbly, calmly.  You can’t afford to go numb now, you know.)

“Barton,” he says with a smile.  “Your Western sense of honour.  “Oh, I will let you go,” Yo",candidate00011
"after a while and I raised my head, meeting his eyes before he went on. ""You don't know how much I tried to hate you."" Again I cringed, knowing full well I deserved his hatred, his contempt.

""I tried, but I can't do it,"" he continued, surprising me. ""You hurt me, Edward. I know we weren't always perfect, but seeing you kiss that guy-"" He turned his head and stared at a couple of kids playing near the tree line. He took a few deep, stuttering breaths and fisted his hands. Slightly shaking his head, as if ridding it of the memory of that night, he turned back to me.

""You really hurt me, but it hurts even more to not be with you,"" he whispered, reaching out his hand and cupping my face. I leaned into his touch, closing my eyes as I felt his warmth radiate through me. He'd always been my home and he still was.

""I just want to know why, Ed. I try to forget and God knows I want to forgive, but I need to know why you did it."" His pained words grounded me. We couldn't just go on where we left off. As much as I wanted to, we couldn't. We needed to talk about this and we did.

I told him every single detail about that night. I'd been drunk, but in my guilt I couldn't forget it. I remembered how Garrett smelled, what he said, what I said in return. I remembered the feeling of his rough lips pressed against mine. I remembered how I was shocked and how my whole body recoiled against the unwanted kiss. And I remembered Jasper, the pain and fury in his eyes as he pulled me off the guy. I remembered everything and Jasper listened, never interrupting, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't really believe me.

""I can't help but wonder what would've happened if I hadn't come looking for you,"" he said after I finished. His eyes were fixed on the ground, like the growth of the grass beneath our feet was the most interesting thing in the world. I wanted him to look at me.Needed him to look at me.

""Jazz, please believe me when I say that nothing would've happened. I would've pushed him away and gone home to you,"" I pressed, but he didn't look up. Not right away.

He ran his hand through his hair, his eyes closed, and he sighed deeply before he said, ""Okay.""

My breath hitched, holding it in, waiting for whatever came next.

He took another deep breath and raised his head. ""Okay,"" he said again, but with more conviction now. Then he leaned in toward me and kissed me chastely on my lips. And at that particular moment, I was the happiest man alive.

We tried taking it slow at first, but we spent every single moment together from then on and Jasper asked me to move in with him after a month. I thought he just wanted to be with me as much as I wanted to be with him, but I soon realized that he didn't trust me.

We used to go out on our own; spending a night in a pub with a friend was never a problem. Now, Jasper didn't leave my side. He went everywhere with me and even started driving me to the hospital. I didn't like it, not one bit, but I thought I deserved it. If this helped him, I could live with it and I thought it would change. I really thought that once I showed him that he could trust me, he'd stop.

But he always found a reason to think I wasn't faithful. A single hair on my shirt, a weird smell, even smiling at someone, always ended in a huge fight. Each and every time he steered back to that one night and every time I tried to reassure him that I wouldn't have done anything. He never ever believed me and in the end, I had enough.

He had a flat tire and called me to let me know he couldn't pick me up after work, so I accepted a ride from Dr. Newton, a new young general surgeon at the hospital. I was running a little late because his shift ended half an hour later than mine, and when I got home Jasper was livid.

I wasn't even halfway through the door when he grabbed me and shoved me up against the wall. ""I knew it!"" he screamed. ""Who is he, Edward? Tell me who the fuck he is or I swear to God!""

I stared at him for a minute before my gaze dropped to his hands fisting my jacket. I took both his hands in mine and tried to get him to let go, but he only held me tighter. I raised my head and looked him straight in his eyes as a",candidate00012
", faster, Jazz!” I panted. He grabbed my hips with both hands.

He thrashed into me harder and faster, hitting my prostate with every stroke. He threw his head back and groaned. “Touch me, Jazz, please touch me!”  He didn’t respond, I couldn’t take it anymore. “Fuck, please Jazz, fucking touch me, please.” I whimpered. And only then did he finally curl his long fingers around my cock and I came. I came hard, giving him everything I had. Jasper thrust himself into me deeply one more time, pulling me hard up against him and held me there when he moaned and let himself go. 

“I love you,” he whispered and he collapsed on top of me. I moved my arms around him, pressing his warm body against my chest. We held there until my cum started to stick his shirt to my skin, breathing heavily. 

The pasta putanesca was ruined, so we ordered in. Snuggling up on my couch in shorts and T-shirts, we ate pizza, drank beer and watched an old black and white movie. He caressed my hair when I looked up at him. “I love you, too,” I said and he leaned in and kissed me.

The night had been perfect, Jasper had been perfect. It was the first time he had taken control, but it hadn’t been the last. Some nights I would come home to find him waiting for me besides a cozy fire,and we would make love slowly, passionately. But other nights he’d grab me as I opened the door, demanding me ruthlessly, his eyes black. I loved it when he did that. I loved him and I thought nothing would ever change.

It wasn’t until the night I came home to Jasper sitting on the couch with a worried look on his face, that my life had fallen apart. He smiled at me tentatively; I couldn’t answer it, dread rising in my chest. “I have some really good news!” he said, and for a second, enthusiasm spread over his face. 

“If it’s such good news, than why were you sitting here like a pig waiting for slaughter?” I asked, but I wasn’t sure I wanted to know the answer.

“Well, you know that piece of software I developed and use at my job? I uploaded it as freeware, it hit the net and it was instant success.” He grinned, but this time his dimples didn’t work. I just stared at him, knowing more would follow, and it had. “So I got a call yesterday. It was the people from  the University of California. They want me to join their department of Computer Science.” His face fell slightly as he added; “I said yes.”

My heart was in my throat, trying to beat its way out through my mouth. California. He said yes. I couldn’t go to California. The build of my new project was just starting. I couldn’t just pack up and leave, he knew that! “You already said yes.” I wasn’t expecting an answer, I knew what this meant. He was leaving me, he was leaving me and I couldn’t stop him. I always knew his job wasn’t his big dream. He wanted to develop software, he had been waiting for an opportunity like this his whole life.

In the weeks that followed, I slowly started to pull away from him and he had noticed. We would fight the worst of fights. I would sulk. He would shout. I would hit something. He would throw something. I would shout. He would cry. I would rush to his side and pull him into my arms. He would struggle. I would kiss the top of his head. He would give in, and we would end up in bed, our passionate lovemaking filled with the frustration and despair of our coming separation.

When he finally put down his suitcase in our hallway and turned around to say goodbye, I couldn’t do it. It was almost midnight. I couldn’t let him go, so I ran upstairs, leaving him standing there, a tear running down his cheek. As I lay on the bed that still held his smell, I heard the front door slam. A yellow taxi took my boy away. I let my tears flow freely, burying my head in his pillow.

I watched the fingers of the clock tick away the time until his flight would leave New York, taking him to his new life. Than it hit me; I had been wrong. How could I know I couldn’t stop him if I hadn’t tried? How could I just let him leave my life without fighting? Why wasn’t I at that goddamn airport asking my love to stay?

Within 10 minutes I found myself fully dressed, in my car, going 80 miles an hour down the freeway. I hit the airport with only 30 minutes left. I prayed to god he hadn’t",candidate00012
"I turned to Edward.

""You,"" I said a little harshly, ""back seat, now!""

He stared at me wide-eyed, but didn't move. Rosalie let out a chuckle and leaned in between our seats. Her eyes darted between me and Edward with a touch of amusement.

""I'm serious!"" I exclaimed. ""I would really like to get to my place with the car and all of us inside still intact. You are making this extremely difficult!""

He was still looking confused when he unbuckled his seat belt, but heck if I cared. Jesus, the almost touches and piercing stares were way too distracting! Did he want me to kill us all?

He opened the car and got out with one of those long legs, before he turned back to me and cupped my face with his hand. His lips crashed to mine with force, making me gasp. There was a promise in that kiss, but I wasn't entirely sure what he was promising me. It left me dumbstruck, while he got into the back of the car.

With my hands back on the steering wheel, I breathed in deep and slowly breathed out again. I could do this. I could drive back to my apartment without crashing my car. I could do this without passing out from stress. And I could hopefully do it with the hard-on I was now sporting.

I adjusted the rear view mirror so it would not catch Edward's reflection, and set off back towards the expressway. Breathe, Jasper. All you have to do is breathe.


.


Entering my apartment, I felt a little ashamed. Their house was so warm and homey, while my place was cold and empty. It was modern and expansive and tasteful, but not a home. I used an interior decorator when I moved in and she picked everything; from the heavy white curtains, to the grey wooden floor and the black leather couch. I would change it sometime soon. Maybe paint a wall, put up some pictures. Yeah, I needed a home more like Rosalie and Edward's.

""All right, I'll show you around,"" I said as I picked up Rosalie's heavy suitcases and moved toward the spare bedroom. ""Kitchen to the right, bathroom to the left, my bedroom is the left door straight ahead and this,"" I said while opening the door to the large spare, ""is the guest bedroom.""

""That isn't much of a tour,"" Edward replied. ""I haven't seen anything.""

I put down the suitcases and rolled my eyes at Edward.

""It's a 1200 square feet apartment. There isn't much to see, Edward,"" I said amused.

""Oh, I'm sure there is,"" he retorted and walked back into the hallway. Rosalie gave me a shove to follow him and turned to opening her suitcase.

He opened the doors one by one, looking around as if he was contemplating buying the place. When he opened the door to my bedroom, I was shuffling my feet. He peeked his head around the door and then turned it towards me.

""So, this is where- How do you Yanks say this? The magic happens?"" he asked me with a grin on his face. Fucker!

""Uh, I eh-"" I started, while feeling my cheeks redden. I cleared my throat. Manly, Jasper! Get your shit together! I straightened my back a little.

""Yeah, my personal palace of pleasure,"" I answered. I tried to sound all confident, but wasn't sure if it was working.

""Palace of pleasure, eh? I'll have to get myself an invitation sometimes,"" he smirked. Fucker!

""So,"" I said a little louder so Rosalie would hear me, ""will you two newlyweds be okay sharing the spare?""

""What newlyweds?"" her voice called into the hallway, quickly followed by the woman herself. ""Edward here stood me up. And fucking dramatic at that! I was already in my wedding dress when he burst through the doors screaming he wasn't going to marry me."" She sounded angry, but the huge smile on her face was telling a different story.

""He was going on and on about how he couldn't go through with it, because he was in love with this guy. A guy, can you imagine that?"" She winked at me and went on. ""It's the tragedy of the century if you ask me. Perfect bride, being left at the altar by homosexual fiancé.""

""Oh, shut it, Rosalie,"" Edward said. ""There's nothing tragic about it and you know it.""

""But daaaarling, how could you?"" she replied in mock hurt. ""Jasper, you should've seen his stepmother's face. She was all; 'Oh my God, my son is gay!' She even cried!"" I couldn't help but laugh at the way Rosalie impersonated her ex-mother-in-law-to-be.

""Bloody drama queen",candidate00012
"place, but decided against it. What if he didn't want to hold hands out in public? We had only just shared a kiss. This didn't mean we were dating or anything, did it? Maybe it was better if I let it up to him to decide if he wanted to hold my hand or not. Yeah, that was way better.

Only he didn't take my hand again, he didn't even look at me. Tyler threw his arm around Edward and led him to the restaurant, engaging him in a whispered conversation. I didn't know why, but it made me feel uneasy and uncertain. I grabbed my pack tighter and stalked after them.

I felt her hand on the small of my back before I heard her voice. ""So, wow,"" Lauren said as she came up beside me, ""you and Edward finally kissed, eh?"" I opened my mouth to respond, but she clearly didn't need an answer. ""I think it's really cool,"" she went on without taking a pause to breathe. ""I knew it wouldn't take long for him to just cut to the chase and do something. I mean, God, Jasper, you just kept ignoring the guy's advances like you didn't even know he was making them!""

Wait, what? Advances? Edward had made advances? I shook my head in surprise, trying to clear it and think back to see if I had missed anything. I really didn't think I had, and I was about to comment on that when Jessica threw her arm around Lauren, chatting loudly about Tyler and how she thought Lauren and he were perfect for each other.

I quietly followed them inside and sat down in one of the booths. Edward had sat down with Mike, Tyler and Ben. I could have probably pulled up a chair to sit with them, but I didn't want to be clingy or anything. Instead, I shared a table with the coach and the girls. They really tried to pull me into their conversation, but my mind was elsewhere. I was confused, to be honest. What made Edward kiss me in the first place? Did he like me the way I liked him? That didn't seem very probable; he was perfect in every way. He looked good, he was talented, he was popular and could have anyone, to be honest. Me, well, I won't spend too many words on me. I was plain, boring and socially awkward. There was no reason at all for him to like me. And yet he kissed you.

I picked apart my slice of pizza and moved the pieces around on my plate while trying to steal looks at him from the corner of my eye. He was sitting with his back to me, but every once in a while, he would turn his head and look at me. This made me return my gaze to my plate or the girls right away. I didn't want him to think that I was drooling over him; though, of course, I was.

When everyone was about finished, Mike came up to the table and invited us to a party at his place, to celebrate our team's victory. The girls all excitedly said yes, and he turned to me. I eyed Edward, who was looking at me with a hopeful smile on his face. I opened my mouth to accept, but as soon as I sucked in the air needed to talk, the breath turned into a yawn. I was tired as hell from today's physical exertion.

""I'm sorry, Mike. As much as I would love to, I think it would be best if I went home and had a decent night's sleep,"" I answered.

He slapped my back and grinned. ""No problem, man. Shame though, I think Edward will be very disappointed,"" he said and got back to their table.

Deciding this would be a good time to leave, I stood up and said my goodbyes to the girls and the coach. I waved at the rest of the team and called out my goodbyes. Edward shot up from his seat and rushed to my side as I picked up my pack and made my way to the exit.

""Hey,"" he called, ""Wait up!""

I paused, and turned to face him. There was a hurt expression on his face, and I wondered if I had put it there. He answered my unspoken question with one of his own. ""You're leaving without even saying goodbye?"" he asked, and his gaze dropped to the floor, his lips forming the most adorable pout I had ever seen in my life.

""I, uhm,"" I started, insecurity flooding through my veins. ""Sorry, I didn't know if you wanted me to come and say goodbye.""

His head shot up and he looked me straight in my eyes as his left eyebrow raised slightly. ""You didn't know if I wanted you to say goodbye to me?"" he asked",candidate00012
"his tongue in a delicious but agonizing dance around my pulsating muscle. It wasn't enough, it was no where near enough, and he knew it. He knew full well how he could drive me insane, giving me just enough to hold me on edge, but not giving me what I wanted and needed so badly.

""Jay, come on!"" I groaned. Then, finally, he inched his thumb into my ass. I pressed back to make him fill me further, but he wasn't letting me. As I pressed, he pulled, never giving me more than he was willing to give. Lust and want were coursing through my body, lighting my nerve endings on fire, flaming and scorching every last strand of rational thought.

I whimpered as his thumb left me, pleading for him to stop teasing me. I could faintly hear him capping the lube through the sound of blood searing behind my ears and I smiled. He latched his mouth to my puckered skin and sucked before he pulled his lips away, replacing them with his slicked up fingers. First one, but quickly two fingers fucked my ass.

""Jasper, I need you, please! Fuck me!"" I screamed shamelessly when his long fingers grazed my prostate.

""You want me, Edward? You want my cock to fill you?"" he asked, but my heavy, panting breaths didn't leave me any chance to answer. Instead, I nodded my head frantically, moaning and grunting like a mad man. His fingers left my ass and I couldn't stay still. My hips rocked back and forth, eager for his gorgeous dick to fill me. Every second it took him to roll a condom down his rock hard length, was a second to long. When he grabbed my hips with both his hands and pulled me back, I was so ready for him, on my hands and knees, waiting.

Then his cock finally rounded up to my hole. Words couldn't even begin to explain the feelings rushing through me. It dazzled me every time, like I felt him for the very first time each time he slowly entered me. It burned, but it was a welcome pain as it announced the sensations directly following it.

His tantalizingly slow thrusts were difficult to endure. I wanted him harder. I wanted him faster. I wanted to feel his thick length claiming my ass as his. And it was. It was his alone.

""Fuck, it's so hot to see my cock disappear into your greedy hole, Edward. You have no idea how much it turns me on to see it clench around me with each thrust,"" he groaned. ""But I need to see your eyes, babe. I want to see the flushed expression on your face, knowing I put it there. Turn around for me, Edward.""

I instantly missed him when he pulled away from me. I quickly rolled over to have him back where he belonged. And when he leaned into me, I lifted my legs to his shoulders and grabbed his cock, leading it to my entrance. With a hard and deep thrust he was again inside, filling me entirely, not holding back. Picking up a faster pace, he pounded into me, while biting my calf.

""Fuck, Jasper!"" I yelled when he grabbed my hips and raised them off the bed, getting a better angle to pound roughly at my prostate with every thrust. His nails dug into my cheeks as he supported me in mid air. He threw his head back and moaned endlessly.

I lowered my legs and wrapped them around his waist, my heels taking leverage against his ass. With a quick movement, I surprised him by flipping him to his side and pushing up my weight so I straddled him. I raised myself with my hands on his abs, until only the head of his cock was inside me, and slammed my ass down. Jasper grunted open mouthed and closed his eyes. Again I lifted and slammed down, his strangled gasp rewarding me. I rode his cock like that, impaling myself on it in a fast pace.

His hands grabbed my hips, letting his fingers dig into my skin painfully. Only the feeling just added to my pleasure, his strength just turning me on further. He held me steady as he bucked up his hips again and again, exquisitely fucking me into oblivion. His breathing quickened and I knew he was close to coming.

Wrapping my own hand around my cock, I started jerking myself to the rhythm of his thrusts, determined to come at the same time. They became more frantic as he pounded me with abandon. When he screamed out my name and his body shook and shivered, I let the pressure in my cock take hold of me and came all over his heaving chest.

Leaning back, I grabbed his knees, rolling my hips a few times to savor the feeling of his dick up my ass as my contracting muscles milked the last drops of cum from him. When I slowly came down from my orgasmic high and the weight of physical exhaustion washed over me, I let myself fall to the side while his",candidate00012
"-month relationship had finally hit the rocks, but I was pissed off that I had to catch him cheating in my house. My house, for fuck's sake. I come home from the worst night at the hospital ever, and I find him sprawled over the kitchen table, some stupid twink pounding him like a lunatic. Bareback!

That's not even what pissed me off the most. The fucking idiot! I knew it was a bad idea to have sex with him without a condom the first time he brought it up. I was so fucking happy I had refused him on that.

Trying to force all thoughts of Riley to the back of my mind, I pulled a black long sleeved T-shirt over my head and smiled. This was actually the same shirt I'd worn the year before. At the same place I was going to be tonight, Extase. This year, however, would be totally different. It would be James, me, Victoria, Seth and his wife Leah. We would have a few drinks, a nice dinner and a lot of fun. The bar would be closed for the evening, though no one ever came in on Christmas Eve anyway.

I wasn't entirely happy with our friends turning up for our holiday-free evening, but James assured me it wasn't a Christmas dinner. We'd have fun if we felt like it, no strings attached. I thought it was a crock of shit, and thought about just staying home, but for some reason he really wanted me to be there.

I couldn't help myself from wandering back to last year and Jasper. Fuck! I thought he was attractive back then, but over the last couple of months, I think I actually fell for him. The first time I had seen him after that night was at James and Victoria's wedding.


He'd been tanned all over, and looked like a California surfer boy. I had just started getting serious with Riley, and didn't think it appropriate to go and talk to him.



He'd come to find me when I was at the bar though, and we had a really good conversation about the value of marriage. For some reason, we really clicked, even though we had such different views on life in general. When I asked why he hadn't been back to Extase, he told me he had gone to Australia for a year, and only came back for the wedding.



That's when Riley came back from the buffet and threw his arm around my waist, introducing himself. I could see Jasper's face fall, and it really bothered me. Though at the time I didn't realise why.



The second time was at Extase. I was on the dance floor, dancing with my friend Bella, when a pair of hands grabbed my hips. This wouldn't be the first time that someone got up close and personal, but it was the first time the hands belonged to a guy. Well, apart from Riley's hands, but these were definitely not his.



When I turned around, a pair of smirking blue eyes looked back at me and he winked. ""Did ya miss me?"" he asked, trailing his gaze down my body and back up again. I was kind of shocked to see him, as he was supposed to be on the other side of the world, but he burst out into a fit of laughter at the sight of my gawking face, and I couldn't help but join him.



We spent the night talking at the bar, while James threw me questioning glances every now and then. I ignored it. Yes, I was still with Riley -telling Jasper that had made his face fall again- but this guy had a pull on me that I couldn't deny. It was after that night that I realised that I really liked him, and wasn't just attracted to him.



The third and last time I saw him was on my birthday. He just showed up at the surprise party James threw me. I don't know why my best friend even bothered, because I never cared for celebrating my birthday. I was sure he just wanted to throw a party, and used this as a reason to do so.



Riley was once again drunk to a point where it was embarrassing, when the door opened and Jasper hesitantly walked in. It was like the hairs on the back of my neck rose in anxious anticipation, though I was fairly sure it was just the cold draft from outside.



He came right up to me and handed me a present. No one at the party had given me a present, seeing they all knew how much I hated forced tokens of appreciation, so for a moment I just glared at him.


""I know you don't like birthday presents, but this isn't really one. I got you this a couple of months back, the birthday is just a ruse. I didn't think it appropriate for a guy to give a practical stranger a random gift,"" he said",candidate00012
"Jess, I just dropped my phone. You know, I really couldn't, Jasper is my best friend. I know you guys aren't really dating and all, but it doesn't feel right."" It wouldn't feel right if you weren't screwing my best friend actually, it would never feel right, you being a girl and all.

""Oh, aren't you a good friend. It's just that, Jasper and I really have nothing going on between us."" She was quiet for a second. ""But you're right, he will NOT like me and you together. Well, a girl could try. Have a great evening, babe. Call me should you change your mind!""

I put my phone back into my pocket and took a plate of pasta.

I wished I could go and do something with Jazz tonight, but Thursdays he had to work. He worked at some death metal bar till the early morning. No, tonight I would spend another pathetic lonely night with Troy and Harley.


Friday


I'm so fucked! I thought as I ran through the halls of the university. Class started 5 minutes ago and Mr. Deacon never let anyone in after the doors closed. My phone buzzed as I neared the corner that led to the lecture hall, and I checked the caller ID when I sped around the corner. As I ran into a firm body, my phone spun out of my hand and hit the far wall with a loud bang. The collision threw me back and I landed on my ass.

I looked up and opened my mouth to apologize, but stared right into Jasper's eyes. ""Fuck Seth, you in a hurry?"" he grinned at me widely. Fucking dimples! ""You weren't here yet and I wasn't spending 2 hours in class without you, I'd be bored to death in the first 10 minutes. Why didn't you pick up the phone?""

""Well, let me think; I ran into you while trying and I think I killed it."" I said dryly. We both glanced at the pieces of plastic that were once my phone. ""Fuck! I can't afford a new fucking phone!""

""Don't you worry that pretty little head of yours!"" Jasper said. ""I'll get you a new one!""

""Jazz, you can't buy me a phone, it's not like you have much more money than I do,"" I told him.

""Let me worry about my financial state. That isn't your job, is it?"" he challenged me, with a weird look on his face. I didn't get it; lately he was throwing money around like a fucking pimp! Where did he get it? Was he doing something criminal? Gambling? ""Let's go, we'll pick you up some tech on our way to my apartment.""

.

That night I sat at the kitchen table with my new phone in my hand. Jasper had insisted on getting me a brand new Iphone and spent the rest of the day filling the 64 gigabytes with music, silly games and other applications. It felt wrong, so wrong. I didn't know how he had the money, but I wasn't sure he got it legally.

I hadn't said anything, because I didn't want him to be angry at me. But I had been sitting at this table since he dropped me off at my place over an hour ago. I didn't care that I had next to no money. I'd work 60 hours a week over the summer if I had to; I would pay Jasper back the money for the phone and the clothes.

""Hey Seth, I'm off?"" I looked up to see Edward standing in the hall with a suitcase in hand and his laptop bag flung over his shoulder. I looked at him questioningly. Edward barely left the house, only to get a new game card.

""Seriously, Seth, I wonder where your mind lives sometimes. I have a LAN party this weekend, I won't be back till Monday!"" he said. I didn't even know what a LAN party was - something nerdy no question.

""Erm, bye!"" I called as he walked out the door.

I was alone, on a Friday night, with nothing to do. I guess I'll get myself a date with Troy and Harley then. I thought and went to get my laptop. Since Edward wasn't going to be back the rest of the weekend, I put the laptop on the coffee table and settled down naked on our leather couch.

When I opened the website, I smiled. A new video by Troy and Harley had been uploaded. I clicked the link and sat back. The men were wearing the same masks but this video was shot in some sort of warehouse. It didn't take long for them to get naked and Troy got to his knees to suck Harley. I watched as the perfectly straight long",candidate00012
", drinking a pop. I didn't see the point. She couldn't taste it.

""So… I've got nothing to do. You wanna go fight crime?"" I said.

""Kick. Ass."" Runechild said. ""Where do we start?""

I had to think about that. ""Well, Brockton Bay is kind of a shithole.""

""Still?""

""Yup. So there's lot of places to start. There's the Empire, but… I don't want to fight them in case Krieg takes over, because then it makes things harder for me.""

Runechild raised an eyebrow. ""Why would you fight the Empire? Aren't you a Nazi?""

My jaw might have hit the floor. ""What?""

""Yeah."" Runechild sounded confused. ""You hang out with Nazis, and you're planning to help Allfather take over the Empire. I just figured. I mean, you're nicer to me than Allfather, so you're probably not a very good Nazi, but still.""

""I'm not a Nazi."" I said firmly. ""The thing with the Empire is just because of my contract with Allfather. If you'd contracted to take over the ABB, I'd probably help you with that in the same way.""

She shivered. ""Let's stay away from them.""

I didn't press the issue. We both lapsed into thoughtful silence.

It seemed like my ruse to masquerade as an Empire cape had been successful enough to convince an impressionable twelve-year old girl. That whole thing was… did I even need it? Was associating with the Empire to protect Dad worth the effort?

My contract with Michael had opened a lot of new doors for me. Enough that I felt confident in being able to walk away from the Empire before things got serious. Allfather was definitely the deal-breaker though. If Allfather wasn't going to be in charge, I had some serious misgivings. I didn't know who Krieg was or what he was like. I couldn't count on him to honor the same things that Allfather would, and I didn't trust him in the same way.

It was sounding more and more promising to just strike out on my own and gather ghosts solo. I'd always wanted to be a hero, but more than that now, I wanted to live. It eclipsed any other goals I had. Now that I had a chance to come back, I was going to claw my way back to life. Getting entangled with the Empire would just impair that.

The warehouse door swung open and Allfather strode in. He was wearing civilian clothes again. Speak of the devil…

""Say hi to the fuhrer for me, fraulein."" Runechild said with a smirk. She skipped off down the catwalk. I let my solidity go, phasing through the catwalk to the floor below.

""Hey."" I said. Seeing Allfather was awkward. I knew he didn't want to see me, but now that I saw him, I realized that I missed talking to him.

""Taylor. Are you ready for the rally tomorrow?"" He said. ""You've got that costume, but have you gone over the speech we prepared?""

""Yeah. I practiced a bunch earlier. Noriko helped me.""

""I see. The entire city is going to watch. If you don't feel comfortable, I can speak instead.""

What he was saying should have been comforting; offering to take a burden off me. But the way he said it was so cold and formal that it just made me uneasy.

""I can do it. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.""

""See that you don't."" Allfather said. He was already turning to leave.

I dithered there, trying to think of something to say, something to mend the distance that had formed between us. My failings had driven Dad and me apart, and now it was happening again.

""I'm looking forward to completing our contract!"" I shouted.

Okay, so maybe I was pretty pissed off at him too. He'd ditched me in a warehouse for a week because he was too upset to deal with me.

Allfather froze, one hand reaching for the door.

""What did you say?""

""You heard me.""

He turned on his heel and in an instant, towered over me; his stare as cold and hard as ice.

""Taylor, think carefully about what you're going to-""

""I'm not joining the Empire either."" I met his eye without flinching. Allfather opened his mouth and I cut him off again. Time to go all in.

""Why have you been avoiding me?""

""I haven't been.""

""Don't lie to me Allfather. I thought we were on better terms than that.""

A red flush was rising in his face. Was it embarrassment, or just simple anger?

""Taylor, I wouldn't lie- I just…"" Allfather dropped his gaze. ""I",candidate00013
"let her bomber jacket fall to the floor, exposing her under-tank, drawn tight over a body like an olympic athlete. 


The sprawling heart and rose tattoos on her biceps were as vivid as ever.

Her sister’s smile hitched a tad. “It’s Magdalene, now. Remember?”

Bethany was tapping her pockets again. Where was her lighter? Where was it?! “So I’m ‘Bethie,’ but you don’t get to be Big Sis Mags?”


 “
Ma’am, are you ready to check out?” the clerk interrupted. 



 Bethany jerked- she’d forgotten he was there. “Get out of here, you stupid fuck!” He stared, all blank doe-eyes at her. Bethany snarled at him and let hellfire bloom in her palm. “This is a robbery, now 
run you fucking moron
!”


The kid gaped, then turned to run. He was scrambling for the door into the employee’s quarters when Bethany turned away.

Maggie was watching her, thumbs hooked into the straps of her top like suspenders. “I’m going to have to kill him,” she said. “No witnesses, remember?”

“He won’t remember. Muggles can’t comprehend shit.” She was back to patting herself down, trying to find her lighter. She needed to self-immolate, to burn herself with something. Magical flame didn’t have the same effect- she couldn’t power herself by burning herself with the thing she was powering.

And… she didn’t have it. She’d left it in the car. Wait- the car. She wasn’t here alone. Maggie was standing between her and the door, but that didn’t mean much.

Bethany pointed and fired. A tiny fireball rocketed from her fingertip and shot through the glass of the front door. It hit the tarmac outside and burst, scattering sparks everywhere. She was hoping it’d start a fire out there, something mundane to fuel herself with, but it was no dice. It sputtered out, even as the last of the glass was falling.

“Looking for someone?” Maggie said calmly.

Another figure stepped into view in the doorframe. Red hair, cut short enough to expose the pale scalp beneath it. Gangly and incongruous in his button-down shirt and slacks, looking more like a budget Jehovah’s Witness than anything.

Lazarus.

“How’s it going?” he drawled, the twang in his voice more pronounced than in Maggie’s. “Just runnin errands, Bethany?”


 He stepped through the doors, coming more clearly into her sight. Blood poured from his eyes and followed in his wake like a slug-trail. 
A 
gash
 across his neck was 
spurting
 onto his shirt, slowly dyeing it red, even as the wound closed.


“Did you get her?” Maggie asked.

“Eve got away. Wounded her, but then she ran for it when I regenerated.” He fingered his neck for a moment, probing the cut. It closed a bit more as Bethany watched.


Maggie shrugged. “We’ll just get her afterward.” She tilted her head to one side, then the other, cracking her neck. 



 “Anyone ever tell you two-on-one is bullshit?” Bethany said. She could hear muffled pounding from inside the office. The kid hadn’t gotten out, which meant there was no exit there. There should be a fire door in back, 
but she hadn’t seen one yet. Maybe by the bathrooms?


The bathrooms that were almost certainly down a dead-end hallway if there was no fire door.


Slowly, Bethany reached out and snagged the brown paper bag the clerk had been using to store her groceries. The carton of cigarettes he’d pulled was beside it. She grabbed that too, tearing it open one-handed. 



 Her siblings were beginning to fan out. Maggie was stalking toward her, taking her time. Lazarus was hovering in the background, poised to cut off any escape routes with his shots. 
Two-on-one was bullshit though. Solo, she’d be able to take either one of them, but together they could cover their weaknesses.



 “So,” Maggie was saying. “Lilith really needs to be more careful. She’s 
very
 distinctive with all those brats of hers.”


Bethany paused with a cigarette halfway to her lips, her blood running cold. They knew where the apartment was. Lilith was vulnerable. They’d waited until they’d split up and moved in.

She pressed a second cig in beside the first. Lit both.

She grinned around them, letting her fire grow for the first time in days. “You stay the fuck away from my sister.” The tips of her twintails ignited, her hair rippling in the heat wave, her eyes suddenly full of hellfire.

The bag burst into flame in her hand, the carton burning a moment later. Their ignition was magical, but their incineration was purely mundane. Beth’s grin grew wider as the fire burnt through the flesh of her palm,",candidate00013
"When we're done, bleeding Hugo Masters out over the floor drain like wild game, she's still flushed, lips parted just a little.

Slowly, she reaches out. I let her, curious to see what mechanisms drive this new quantity.

Her nails are seafoam green, chipped from working the hammer. She presses her fingertips to my lips. A caress- no a brush, as she draws back, her fingers red. Some of the blood splatter wiped away.

Madison raises fingers to mouth and paints her lips red, seafoam nails dripping and crimson.

A shuddering, breathy little noise from her, eyes half-shut, teeth worrying bloody lip. The tremor that shakes her petite frame is… familiar. The trembling joy- the sheer rush- the power trip. These things, I know.

For the first time since meeting her, I feel at ease.

XXX

We walk home together. It's been a while since I last had a sleepover. Madison is quiet most of the way; the silence is comfortable.

It's only as we're entering the final stretch that she pastes herself to my side, arm knitting into mine. A soft, contented sigh.

She's not quite Emma, but there's nothing wrong with that. The differences, the tuneless humming that she starts up as we walk, the slight boniness of her shoulder in my ribs. These things are present, and I accept them.

There is something different in the hunger inside me as I watch Madison's giddy, almost loopy smile. She is not Emma, nor Sophia, but she is broken all the same.

And the hunger in her is all the connection we need.

XXX

Sophia is the first and last. I've shared my darkness with her the longest, but she is bound, a collared tiger under the Protectorate.

Our first kill together was special. By far the most planning for one execution. A bit clumsy in retrospect, some kinks that'd be worked out in the future. She doesn't take part, waiting outside while I work. But she listens, and it couldn't have happened without her aid.

I know she's killed before. But I also know that none of those were deliberate. Missteps. Clumsier by far than my first kill. Errors in judgment- a crossbow wound that bled out. A man dangled and then dropped on accident. Others, never concealed for too long.

She was young and dumb, and I'd like to think I have better judgment, but Jamie Masters proves me wrong. Sophia at least has the advantage of being a cape. A get-out-of-jail card in the Protectorate.

In the weeks after, I continue my predations. She assists as she can, a name here, a tip there, but under watch there is only so much she can do. Emma and Madison are with me, participating a little more each time.

I begin to worry. Not the usual paranoia or suspicion. Concern that Sophia, who facilitated my first, our first, has begun to drift away.

And so I call her.

XXX

Sophia picks the target.

We meet, clandestine, lugging him into a building I scouted the week before. She phases through the door, unlocks it, and we're in.

It's only as I begin tying him to the chair that she glances around.

""Where's the other two?""

I look over my shoulder and give her a carefully practiced 'friend' smile. ""It's just us tonight.""

I even light some candles to set the mood.

XXX

His name is Kevin Reiners- though he won't divulge that until I work on his face with the same little propane torch I used to light the candles. Judging by the elaborate tattoos on his body, he's spent quite a bit of time with E88. I take my time melting them away, and when that grows tiring, try my hand at the cheese grater.

I don't know what he's done to earn her ire, but Sophia stays, silent, dark, watchful, a presence at the back of the room.

Round One ends with him screaming himself hoarse. I step back to take a breather and work the stiffness out of my hands.

Our eyes meet.

Her eyebrow rises.

I look pointedly at Kevin Reiners.

She stares between us for a long moment. And then she walks out of the room.

I find myself sighing, a little disappointed, and I'm having trouble working up much excitement for Round Two.

The door opens again.

Sophia pads in. She has a jug of the bleach I use for cleanup.

Oh hoh. The flare of hunger, of curious wonder is enough that I set down my knife entirely.

I move aside.

This is her show now. Her first real, true kill.

I expect her to dump it down his throat. Not in the eyes or his wounds or any of that. My gut says she's too pragmatic to waste time when there could",candidate00013
"checking for threats, for anyone who might do something, and then returned to staring at the floor.

A man sat down in the seat across the aisle from her. Taylor turned away so he couldn't see what a mess she was. Hopefully, and she almost laughed bitterly at the thought, he'd think she was just another homeless person.

The bus started up again, turning down a side street as it headed for the next stop. There would be four more before hers.

""Excuse me.""

The landscape outside blurred into a mélange of shapes and colors; all dirty buildings and concrete.

""Miss?""

Taylor blinked. She looked up.

The man in the other seat was eyeing her. He held out a hand, and she drew back reflexively.

""It's alright,"" he said. He opened his hand, showing her a folded white handkerchief. ""See?""

She stared, making no move to take it. Annoyance flared up inside her. Why couldn't he just leave her alone and mind his own business? She looked at him again. What was this about? People didn't just do stuff like this in Brockton Bay.

The man's age was indeterminate, older than thirty, maybe forty, from the fine lines at the corners of his dark eyes, but it was hard to say. He had a… vitality about him, something in the way he sat, and the calm, knowing smile on his face, that she hated at once. It was an ugly, basic feeling- jealousy that he was happier than her.

The man didn't lower his hand though. ""I don't bite,"" he said, a note of laughter in his voice.

""What do you want?""

His smile widened just a bit. The man brushed a strand of his long, black hair back with his free hand, tucking it back into the loose ponytail he wore. ""You looked like you needed to dry off.""

""Don't worry about it."" She knew she sounded rude, and didn't care. It wasn't his problem.

""Alright then."" He pocketed the handkerchief, but didn't turn away. Taylor's annoyance grew into anger, her fists balling in her lap. Go away. 

""How did that happen?""

""None of your business.""

""Of course not."" He shrugged lazily. ""Doesn't mean I can't be curious.""

She returned to looking out the window and didn't answer.

""I'm a bit of a people person,"" the man continued, his voice still calm and undaunted by her rejection. ""And right now… I'd say you're having a bad time.""


No shit.


""Teenage girl, alone on her own in the middle of a school day, all covered in… what is that- soda? Having trouble at school, darling?""

Taylor whipped around, all her frustration from the day boiling over, pushed past the breaking point by this man who just-wouldn't-go.

""Fuck off!"" she hissed at him.

A few nearby passengers glanced back at her, and she lowered her voice even further, snarling her words at the man.

""Just leave me alone. What do you care, huh?!""

He only blinked slowly. ""Like I said, kiddo, I'm just a curious observer. I saw someone in-"" He paused. ""Someone who needed someone else to talk to.""

She curled her lip at him, uncaring of what he thought- he was a stranger. ""Leave me alone.""

""What does it cost you?""

That stopped her. She squinted at him through her smudged glasses. The man had an angular face, his chin lightly-stubbled; he looked vaguely familiar. She didn't know him from somewhere, did she? Was that why he was being so odd?

""What does what cost me?""

""To talk to me,"" he explained.

The bus came to a stop, and their conversation paused while passengers came on and off.

""Why would I want to talk to you?""

""Why not?""

She turned to fully face him for the first time. Her anger had ebbed, replaced with something more like incredulity at the man's sheer persistence.

""I'm a stranger,"" he said. ""I don't want anything from you, and I thought you might like a friendly ear to ah- vent to."" The man held up his hands as if to say 'why not?' ""Besides, I'm only in town for a week or two, tops, for business.""

Taylor didn't answer him. The red flags were still up; this whole thing felt eerie, but the man was just so earnest… and insistent. Was he maybe- was this a gang thing? Did gangs recruit like this? She bit her lip. What if it was some kind of weird sex thing? An older man trying to pick up a teenage girl.

She dismissed that thought as quickly as it came.",candidate00013
"The Dust needed to be dissolved, and then it needed to be attuned. Putting unattuned Dust into the body was like throwing gunpowder into a fire. The Dust was out of sync with the user’s aura, and they would war, vibrating against each other until the Dust inevitably ignited.

There were chemicals that could aid this step. Solvents could liquefy the Dust, and then be separated with the centrifuge. But that would be slow, and the centrifuge was just as loud as the grinder.

She focused on the vial, on the smooth glass pressing into her palms. It was easier to think about that, to center on it, than on herself. It was a goal, and possibly… a solution.

Her aura surrounded her at all times, a second skin. It took a conscious effort to move it, an atrophied limb stirring into motion, and-

She hissed as her aura pulsed down her arms. The first minute felt like sunburn on the inside of her skin; tender flesh and muscle crying out as her aura seared them. The tube flared with a flickering, misty light as she suffused it, holding on even as her limbs ached.

Aura met Dust. The blood began to churn as she enfolded the grains, not activating, but grinding them even more. She’d described it to her father as being like ‘stones in the ocean.’ Larger pieces were worn down and broken apart with constant motion. Her aura moved in steady, rhythmic waves grinding the grains of Dust together, using their own friction to wear them down.

It was a calming, soothing metaphor that didn’t really take in how much it hurt.

The second minute was worse. Her hands began seizing around the tube, muscles writhing under the skin as the pain escalated to a white-hot burn. The flow stuttered, thinning, and Wynn gritted her teeth.

“Not yet. Not yet.”

Her aura was dwindling, slowly and inevitably. Her body was shutting off the external aspect of her aura in the same automatic way it might shiver in the cold. It was the hard limit that prevented her from spending a lethal amount of lifeforce.

“Just-a-little-more.”

Each compression was like working handfuls of molten sand now, her aura screaming as she forced it to move. Necessity kept her going. This had to happen.

Slowly, the Dust began to dissolve, melting into the blood like sugar in water. She closed her fists around the vial and pushed. The psychic “channels” that her aura flowed through were pinholes now, and she whined with pain as she forced them past their capacity. The Dust was thrumming in her hands, a song just out of tune with her own.

It was reacting in a way she’d never seen before. Her aura was moving in ways outside her direction, caught in a flow she hadn’t made. Fighting it felt wrong, like walking against a river. Wynn let her aura move as it needed to, and found her eyes going wide as the Dust grains began to burst. They weren’t igniting- this was like seeds germinating; she was completing something in the Dust, and they were dissolving, merging seamlessly into her blood.

This had never happened before. Previous samples usually ended up gritty, full of grains that refused to dissolve. It was a-

“Miss Schnee?”

She jerked with surprise, nearly falling off her stool.

“Miss Schnee, are you in there?” Someone called from outside. Dimly, she thought it might be one of the maids. The knob turned, then caught. “It’s time to get ready, Miss.”

“I’m busy,” Wynn snapped, trying to keep her voice level around the furious heat in her hands. “Come back later.”

There were faint, scuffling footsteps as the woman fretted outside the door, and then-

“Your father was very insistent that you get ready.”

It was definitely one of the maids. Probably Sapphire.

“Go away!”

She paid for her distraction with a surge in her aura. A purple bruise bloomed on the back of her hand as the blood vessels ruptured under the aural pressure.

Wynn yelped, but kept going. The door was specially reinforced to protect her gear. The maid would need a key to get through.

“Are you okay?” Sapphire called, sounding worried. “Did you fall?”

Wynn ignored her.

The last grain melted away, and she let her aura go. The flow rebounded on her like a wild dog, and she had just enough time to drop the vial back into the rack before the spasm hit her. Her hands twitched and curled, her eyes rolling back, back arching, teeth bared in a rictus. She tipped backwards, and only one flailing, kicking leg under the table kept her from toppling over entirely.

From outside came the sound of heels on stone as Sapphire scurried away.

The seizure lasted an eternal minute, Wynn’s body drawn to the breaking point before finally collapsing against the table like a rag doll. It was dumb luck that she didn’t pitch face",candidate00013
"sit down and listen. ‘Ceus, you’re freaking out for nothing.”

Lillie held out a hand for her phone back, but Selene didn’t offer it. They looked at each other for a long moment, Selene blinking drunkenly, Lillie glaring, her heart in her throat.

“Two minutes. And then I’m taking you to a doctor.”

“Anyone ever tell you you’re cute when you’re- urp.” Selene’s words cut off in a gulp. She covered her mouth, eyes wide. Lillie skittered away, but thankfully, Selene shook her head and relaxed.

“False alarm.” Her thumbs-up was the least convincing Lillie had ever seen.

“One minute,” Lillie grumbled. “This isn’t a game, Selene.”

“I know. It’s science.” Selene reached out and rubbed the Clefairy. “Thanks to Clementine here, and my other friends-” She waved at the Pokemon around her.

Lillie gave them her full attention for the first time.

Cinder, Selene’s Salazzle was curled up, tail flicking idly as she watched the conversation. To her left was a slimy, tentacled Pokemon that Lillie didn’t recall the name of. Some kind of aquatic predator with- judging by the thick spines covering its blue flesh, poisonous barbs. Under the table, a vividly colored Ariados was working thread between its chelicerae, weaving long ropes that it looped over its back spines for later use.

There were others, some of Selene’s regular team, but those three and the Clefairy were the closest at the moment.

Lillie squinted. Selene wouldn’t possibly…

“Are you poisoned?!”

Selene touched thumb and index together. “Bingo.”

Lillie lunged for her phone. She toppled into Selene and they both knocked into the kitchen table, scattering Pokemon left and right. She’d been expecting Selene to struggle, but the other girl let her have the phone, and after a moment to right herself from where she’d pressed Selene down, Lillie retreated.

She started dialing again. Not a doctor this time, but the nearest hospital. It would be in Malie City, and that wasn’t close enough. The flight wouldn’t be nearly quick enough. They’d have to ride together, so she could make sure Selene didn’t fall off. And-

“How did this happen?”

Selene jerked a thumb over her shoulder at the rows of science equipment. “I’m trying to build up an immunity so I can train Poison types better.”

Lillie stopped dialing to stare at her.

“Don’t give me that look,” Selene said. “It’s perfectly safe. I take a sample from one of the Pokemon, dilute it with Antidote and a couple other chemicals, and then inject it. I give myself an hour to start feeling it, and then I have Clemmy use Aromatherapy to cure it. Rinse and repeat. I did Ariados last night. That’s why he’s just sitting around.”

Lillie stared some more. The inner workings of her mind ground to a halt. She understood. She didn’t understand.

“You’re… trying to build up… an immunity,” she said slowly.

“Yup. I’ve got Poison Affinity from my Dad’s side, apparently, and I always wanted to specialize in them. Just never got the chance, you know?”

Selene grinned. One eyelid was more open than the other, and she was swaying on her feet.

“And you thought it would be a good idea to do this alone, in the middle of nowhere, with no medical staff on hand, without telling anyone?”

“Well… when you say it like,” Selene said, her grin thinning slightly. “Sounds kinda crazy.”

The last piece of the puzzle fell into place.

“Selene, when was the last time you took your medication?”

“This morning.”

“You mean when you got up?”

“Nope. That’s when I normally take it. But I haven’t slept in a couple days, so I just decided to take it at 9am every morning.”

Lillie frowned. That didn’t make sense. Selene wasn’t behaving rationally. She was normally energetic and creative, and prone to stupid ideas, but… this was downright bizarre and self-destructive. It wasn’t like her at all. This was how she behaved when she missed a dose.

She glanced around the kitchen, taking in the mess of equipment. Where had Selene even gotten this stuff? Team Skull hadn’t been cooking meth or something, had they? Her eyes flicked across Clementine, now dabbling her paws in the sink.


Clemmy uses Aromatherapy to cure it.


“Selene, does Aromatherapy discriminate between chemicals?”

Her girlfriend cocked her head, looking confused.

“How is it supposed to know the difference between the chemicals in poison that hurt you, and the ones in your medication that keep you stable?”

She could tell the moment when it sank it.

Selene blinked slowly. And then her smile faded.",candidate00013
"properly. I roll this along your arm, and you tell where where the feeling stops. Or if it feels wrong.”

Genji’s arms had not originally been cybernetic. Not both of them. There had been more of the left remaining than the right. But there had been issues with weight and balance early on in testing, and she’d finally just amputated and replaced the entirety of both with machinery to settle it. Easier that way.


 His right was 
made of the same grayish material as the rest of his underlayer. Beneath the carapace of his armor was a reinforced layer of fibrous nano-mesh. It did not feel quite like skin to the touch- more like silk, but it was thin enough that she’d been able to work in a full suite of nerve sensors. Touch, pressure, temperature, friction. A ninja’s hands were his livelihood. 
As a surgeon, t
hat, she could appreciate.


Angela began rolling the ball along his fingers. “You were asking about biotech.”

Genji nodded, his gaze following the ball once more.

“I am a surgeon. My work mixes biotic and nanite technology to regenerate form. But it does not create. It could, given time and research.”

He raised an eyebrow at that. “You have both.” He jerked a head at the technological paradise that was the Overwatch medbay.

“I do. Any issues with the feeling? No? Temperature is good?” Genji jerked as she took the ball away and pressed her fingers to his palm. Trimmed nails and cool fingers ghosted along surface of his hand, tracing where the life line would be on a human palm.

Angela smirked up at him. “The anecdote about doctors and cold hands holds true, I am afraid.”

He was stiff, his posture rigid, but he didn’t pull away. Angela gauged his reaction, not stopping her exploration of his palm. She didn’t have to guess to know this was the first human contact he’d had with anyone in quite some time. Shimada was supposedly quite the ladies man in his past life, and the look in his eyes as she held his hand was almost hungry.

“Something wrong?” she said.

“N-no.” He looked away. “Continue talking.”

“I have money, resources, and support,” Angela said. She ended her contact with him, not missing the way his hand followed hers for just an instant as she pulled away. “But I also have limits. These things come with strings.”

She returned to the ball, beginning at his wrist. The seam of flesh to metal, and his weapons attachments, she left alone, save to palpate them to make sure they were settled properly. There was no real sense in probing them with the ball- he had no sensation there. Just the vague pressure identified by the sensors in his skin, like something pressing on a fingernail.

Genji shifted as she nudged the piece of his arm where the armor plating would sit.

“Pain?”

“No.” His gaze dropped. “It feels strange. Like it is a part of me, but not. But… none of this is a part of me.”

“It feels out of place.”

“Yes.”

She rolled the ball across the area she’d repaired. “Good?”

“Fine.”

“Working for Overwatch comes with rules,” she said softly. “We answer to Jack, and he answers to the UN. And if the UN decided at some point after the Omnic Crisis, that one disaster averted was enough, and banned any advanced biotech research, we would have to follow those standards.”

“What?!” Genji jerked forward, nearly rising off the table entirely. “Why?”

“Cloning.” Angela set the ball on the table, pausing in her examination to meet his eyes. “If we created omnics and they turned on us, what would happen if cloning and biotech were allowed to advance to create new life?”

“That’s- that’s insane,” he hissed.

“It is cowardice.” Angela pressed her fingers to the nanofiber of his inner arm. Silken skin passed beneath her fingers. “And that is why we are stuck using prosthetics and cybernetics.”

Genji swore. She did not know the word, it was in his native tongue, but he said it in the tone used for epithets. “Insane. I’m stuck in this thing because they’re afraid. So worried about something that they’ve damned me to this shell.”

“Genji,” Angela said. “Genji, look at me.” She rose. Her hands moved from forearm to elbow to shoulder to chin. His was stubbled, just enough of his skin left for a beard shadow before the underlayer replaced his neck. Angela brushed her fingers through it.

His skin was warm. He stared at her.

“You are you. No matter how much of you is machine, the components that matter are here.”

A single finger pressed to his forehead.

“Please know that I have given you nothing I would not have myself.”

Genji frowned at that",candidate00013
"and smile and steadiness - and though he was loud and confident like his father he’d inherited Periboea’s complete lack of malice. Teucer looked more like Telamon than Ajax did; there was something so like his father in the way her son laughed and tossed his curly head that it made Hesione’s heart hurt.  

But nothing hurt more than Teucer’s absence from the women’s quarters, the emptiness of the long hours spent weaving without his piping voice and endless questions for company. For a while she still had him to herself in the evenings, and could listen and smile while he chattered on about all the exciting things he had done that day. Soon, however, he grew tall enough and strong enough that Telamon began to train him in real combat, and Teucer and Ajax spent nearly every waking moment with their father and the other men. He ate beside his brother in the hall while Hesione still supped with the other servants, and stopped coming to see her at the end of the day. Their most frequent interactions now were chance meetings in the house; he always seemed happy to see her, greeting her with a hug and a kiss and a brief account of his latest exploits, but such encounters never lasted long and always ended with Hesione feeling as though someone had torn her heart from her chest. 

One night, after Telamon had visited her bed and taken his pleasure from her, Hesione sat and massaged his shoulders while the talk turned to their son. Telamon praised Teucer’s progress in all his lessons, and Hesione smiled, though her heart felt like lead.

“I’m glad he fares well,” she began tentatively, hoping Telamon was relaxed enough that this would not rile his temper. “I do miss him, though. I see so little of him now.”

Telamon shrugged. “He will be a man soon, and must learn men’s ways. Be grateful, woman, that I have made him my son instead of a slave, and that he’s proven quick enough to be worth the effort.”

“Still,” said Hesione softly, running her hands down the length of his muscled back, “perhaps he could spend an evening with me every so often? What harm could it do?”

“Enough, Hesione,” Telamon said, and she could feel him tensing under her hands. “He could spend his time with slave women when he was a babe, but he is my son, and I will decide what is best for him now.”

A sudden defiance rose up within her, even though she could read the warning in his words and body. Hesione withdrew her hands and snapped, “Teucer is of the royal line of Troy, one of the greatest in the world. He is my son, too.”

The blow came quick and hard, sending her crashing into the wall before she collapsed on the bed. Face and skull throbbing, she stared up at her master’s furious face and broke into sobs. Telamon’s expression faded from rage to disdain, and he stood and walked away, leaving her weeping on the mattress.

When she encountered Teucer in the hall the next day, the sight of her vivid black eye stopped him cold. “What happened, Mother?” he asked, looking worried. 

“Nothing, dearest,” she assured him, forcing herself to smile. “Just an accident.” She reached out to run a hand through his curls. 

“Oh.” He still looked uncertain, but let her change the subject and chattered to her about his studies until Ajax and some other boys appeared, calling his name. Then he accepted her kiss on the cheek and gave her one in return before scampering off to his friends, high spirits restored. 

Hesione watched him go, feeling fragile enough to shatter. She was losing her boy to a world of men and war and masters, powerless to stop it, and nothing now could ease the loneliness of her days.

Ajax is the biggest man Tecmessa has ever seen. He could kill her with his bare hands in any number of ways, and at first she cannot conceal her fear at his touch. But despite his reputation for relying on brute force, there is very little malice in him. He is not gentle - she’s not sure he knows how to be - but neither is he unduly rough, or purposefully cruel. 

He rarely directs his infamous temper at her; she doesn’t have broken bones, or bruises that never seem to heal, like some of the other slave women do. He has occasionally struck her for displeasing him (open-handed blows that no doubt seemed light to him, yet knocked her off her feet), but such outbursts become ever rarer as she learns how to read his moods and unspoken desires, to satisfy his whims almost before he knows them himself, to bury her grief and pain and weariness as deep as they will go and never let on that she is anything less than pleased to see him when he returns from the battlefield. He rewards her efforts with trinkets and kisses and takes uncomplicated delight in her presence.

"moment and took a few deep, shaky breaths. Then she dabbed at her eyes with a corner of the hospital blanket and asked, “How long?”

“As long as it takes,” said Ezar, his voice hard.

Part of her wanted to start crying again out of sheer relief, but she had not forgotten that banishing Ges from court couldn’t solve more than half her problems, if that. Serg was less creative on his own, but he would be furious that his father had interfered.

Ezar picked up his coat from where it lay across the arm of his chair, and got slowly to his feet, reaching for the handsomely carved cane that leaned against the wall near the door.

“One more thing - I’ve been told there’s a Miss Alys Vormercier asking if she can see you. Shall I have Negri add her to the list of approved visitors?” He must have seen a flicker of worry on her face then, for he added hastily, “I am the only name on the list at present. No one else will be admitted without your express permission.”

Kareen nodded. If Alys had heard anything, she was no doubt worried to distraction already; it would be unkind to keep her in the dark any longer, with only vague official reports and shocking Vor gossip to go on. She would be restful company compared to Ezar, and her presence a pleasant distraction from everything else.

“Very well.” He gave a small, stiff, bow in her direction. “I wish you a quick recovery, Kareen, though you must be careful not to overtax yourself. Stay here for as long as you feel is necessary.” 

She understood, though it scarcely made her feel any better. “Thank you, sire.” 

Ezar’s mouth twisted, but he turned without another word and walked haltingly out of the room, leaning on his cane. Kareen watched him go, then fell back against the pillows with a wince and a sigh. She still felt frightened, but everything seemed oddly distant now, as though her brain had been hollowed out and filled with cotton stuffing. Perhaps it was the drugs. Perhaps her mind had finally broken under the strain of it all. 

With any luck, Alys would visit soon, and her smile would make things seem a little less bleak. 

 

4. 

Kareen looked down at the tiny bundle she held close to her chest, still overwhelmed by a mixture of relief and incredulity. That her son lay in her arms, alive, healthy and sleeping peacefully, seemed nothing short of a miracle. She knew she was supposed to be resting, but she was perfectly comfortable here on the sofa with a blanket tucked around her legs, and the new nurse was just a wristcom call away. There was only one, and she had been vetted by Negri and chosen by Kareen; the fewer people authorized to hold her son, the better. 

Ezar Gregor Vorbarra was not a large baby, and in fact weighed a little less than the Barrayaran average, but according to the doctor he had very long feet and would probably grow up to be quite tall one day. A sparse layer of black hair covered his tiny scalp. His eyes, when not scrunched closed, were blue, but Kareen knew from watching her nieces and nephew as infants that they would likely change color soon, whether to her dark brown or Serg's hazel she couldn't say. He had cried very little so far, and Kareen had scarcely been able to let him out of her sight.  

It was an enormous relief to simply be able to sit quietly by herself after the uproar of the last few days. She had known that the birth of an Imperial heir was traditionally a semi-public event, but nothing could have prepared her for the actual experience of having a baby in front of a roomful of Counts and ministers and assorted High Vor, mostly men she saw regularly and would have to face again soon. The doctors attending her were kind, familiar ones who did their best to keep her calm, but Kareen had still sobbed with relief when Countess Vorob’yev and Alys finally arrived to sit beside her, holding her hands and stroking her hair and offering comfort and encouragement as needed. She hadn’t seen her aunt in almost two years - Count Vorob’yev had never liked Vorbarr Sultana much, and after Ezar had responded to his concerns about Kareen by all but ordering him not to interfere, he’d shunned the capital entirely and deputized his vote to Sasha. 

Even after he was born, it had seemed like an eternity before Kareen was finally allowed to hold her baby. First the doctors had examined him to make sure he had no obvious problems, then they had handed him to his father. Kareen had been so exhausted that she had not been able to keep herself from crying at the sight, though no one in the room save Alys, Ezar, and Serg himself could know for certain that her tears weren’t simply due to some imbalance of hormones. 

Kareen had briefly met Serg’s eyes when he at last gave her the child, and the spark of anger in",candidate00014
"which sits elegantly on the back of her neck in a braided knot. She is an inch or so taller than Haleth, heavily pregnant and noticeably thinner than her sister-in-law, as though every scrap of nourishment has gone to the child growing inside her. Haldan stands close to his mother’s side, and she grips the boy’s shoulder tightly with one white-knuckled hand. Her other hand hangs at her side, fingertips barely brushing the back of Haleth’s. 

Many of the strangers have left now, taking their wounded back to wherever they came from. Their leader and a number of his men remain, though Haleth has not spoken to the elf chieftain since their first conversation; she’s had far too much to do. 

“He must want something from us.” she told Danyal earlier as they worked. “Why else would he wait?”

The other woman frowned. “What could he possibly want? We have nothing.” 

Haleth had no answer for her then, and she has none now, so she ignores the strangers watching from a respectful distance and grasps her sister-in-law’s hand. Their eyes meet, and Haleth nods, letting her know that she is ready to begin.

Danyal sings first, her voice high and quavering, though it soon grows stronger. When the time comes, Haleth joins with the harmony; her tone is harsher and cracked from fatigue, but the pitch rings true and the notes lock into place. Danyal’s grip on her hand is painfully hard as their voices twine together, and as she listens to the sound ring out into the grey sky Haleth feels something loosen inside her. 

The third verse passes, and some part of Haleth realizes that her voice is starting to hurt, but she hardly cares. At the fourth and final verse, the rest of her people join in, wearily, raggedly, dragging the pace of the music until at last the song grinds to a halt. The final chord fades away into a deadened silence.

The circle breaks apart, and in moments Haleth is surrounded by people crying, wailing, hugging friends and family members and lamenting their shared grief. Danyal turns to face the crowd, offering and accepting consolation, but Haleth stays where she is, silent, letting the sounds and people swirl around her. Only Danyal’s anchoring hand keeps her from losing herself completely in the chaos. 

~

“You should rest before speaking to him,” Danyal protests as she helps Haleth out of her battered armor with steady hands. “We don’t know who he is, or what he wants, or whether he means us harm. Make this Lord Caranthir wait until tomorrow, until you’ve gotten a chance to get your strength back.” 

They’ve returned to the tent that Haleth hastily constructed to shelter the two of them and Haldan, where Danyal has carefully stowed all their remaining belongings. Grimacing, Haleth strips off the rest of her clothing, which is caked in grime and dust and blood. 

“You’re right - we have no idea what he means to do. I can’t let him think I’m so weak that I need a full day of recovery before I can even negotiate. Do we have any more clean shirts?” she asks, her face impassive. Danyal nods and hands one to her, along with a formal vest covered in heavy embroidery. Haleth stares at it for a moment, then at her sister-in-law. 

“If you’re really going, you may as well look presentable,” Danyal insists. As Haleth pulls on the shirt and the vest, Danyal dips a clean rag into a basin of water and wrings it out before handing it over. “Wash your face.”

Haleth obeys, though she suspects that removing the layer of dirt from her skin will only make her bruises and the dark circles under her eyes stand out. She accepts the piece of dried meat Danyal shoves into her hands, for though her first thought is to protest that the other woman needs the nourishment more, the look in her sister-in-law’s eyes tells her she that she will not win this argument.

Her last pair of trousers are torn and dirty, and it’s been years since she’s been tall enough to borrow Haldar’s clothing, so she dons a clean skirt with blue embroidery at the hem - her mother’s work.  She fastens Haldad’s old belt and sword around her waist, battered as they are, and stretches out her arms, presenting herself to Danyal for inspection. 

The other woman shakes her head, almost smiling. “Your hair,” she says gently, and Haleth remembers that her hair has been in the same braid for more than a week, practically glued in place with dirt and sweat. Only now does it occur to her that this might be a problem. 

They quickly realize that, despite their best efforts, there is nothing that can be done about the hair while it’s in this condition. Danyal motions for Haleth to sit down, then places the basin on a stool and moves it closer.",candidate00014
"was gracious in his grief, consoling his wife and speaking kindly to Morwen and ruffling Rían’s dark hair. But he could not stay for long, not with Orcs threatening the northern borders of High King Fingon’s realm, and he soon departed for the front again with a heavy heart.

Hareth, who seemed suddenly to have aged ten years, donned mourning clothes and continued overseeing her husband’s lands with her usual competence. Rían, a silent little shadow dressed in black, stayed close to the lady’s side. Morwen, ever solemn and dutiful, took the mourning as well, as befitted Húrin’s betrothed. There was never any talk of sending her and Rían away, and in fact Hareth gave Morwen more responsibility over the household than ever. One day she took the girl aside and said, “I promise I will find suitable marriages for you and Rían, but until then you are welcome in my family.” 

Morwen did not smile, but thanked the older woman and squeezed her hands tightly. 

That night Morwen couldn’t sleep. She pictured Húrin, sitting on his horse and grinning, waving to her as she stood in the courtyard waiting for them to depart; and Huor, only fourteen and already as tall as his father, gallantly accepting a bouquet of wildflowers from Rían. She remembered how Húrin had kissed her on the cheek before saying goodbye. Take care of Rían and my mother while I’m gone, he had told her, taking her hand. I’ll be back before you know it.

When at last she fell asleep, her dreams were troubled. She still slept in the same room as Rían to help ease the younger girl’s frequent nightmares, but tonight it was Morwen who woke up screaming and thrashing, unable to rid her mind of the sight of her grandmother lying in the entrance of the house, cut nearly in two by an Orc spear. Adaer had stood her ground in the doorway to protect her two granddaughters hiding within, shielding them until the soldiers cut her down. Morwen could still remember the sharp terror of that moment, one Orc seizing her roughly while another wrenched Rían out of her grasp, but with her death Grandmother had delayed their foes long enough for Baragund and others to arrive and rescue the girls. 

That night it was Rían who was startled awake by the sound of her cousin crying. “What’s wrong?” she asked, alarmed, and the sight of her frightened face and big dark eyes only made Morwen cry harder. She gathered the child into her arms and rocked her back and forth, clinging to her until the worst of the memories faded.  

By the time Morwen had regained her composure and soothed the distressed eight-year-old back to sleep, she was so exhausted that she did not dream for the rest of the night.

Another season passed with no word of Galdor’s sons, and they had long since given up expecting any. Lady Morwen, as the people had begun to call her, grew taller and lovelier with each passing month, her manner more gracious, though she was colder than the lady Hareth. The servants marveled at how she had changed - from a ragged fugitive, proud in her fear, to a reserved but kindly girl who could smile freely, and now to this somber young woman with a deep understanding of how quickly good fortune could change.

When the messengers came again from Brethil, Morwen half-expected more bad news. Perhaps the lady Hareth's brother had been killed, or they had found her sons' bodies at last. But as she watched from the doorway, she saw Hareth's resigned face suddenly transformed with joy, and she dropped the basket she was carrying and ran to the lady's side. Hareth embraced her, weeping and saying over and over, ""All will be well now, child. All will be well."" 

Soon the news had spread throughout Dor-lómin: Galdor's heirs had been found alive and safe, and were on their way home.  

For the next few days, Hareth exploded in a flurry of activity, sending word to Galdor and furiously planning a great feast to welcome her sons home. Morwen remained in a state of frozen shock. On the day of their arrival, she let the maids help her dress without really noticing what she was wearing, and sat quietly as the Lady of Dor-lómin herself braided her future daughter-in-law's hair and adorned her with some of the family’s finest jewelry. 

The morning of the feast dawned bright and clear, and Morwen stood with Hareth and Rían in front of the house, waiting. As the riders thundered into the courtyard, led by Lord Haldir and several of his men, a great cheer went up from the assembled guests and onlookers. Morwen found she was holding her breath as she searched among them for Húrin and wondered what she would find. But nothing about him suggested that he had been lost in the wilderness for a year - he looked taller, older, more lordly, and there seemed to be an air of responsibility about him, as though he had been",candidate00014

“That is no concern of yours,” Gimilzôr snapped.

“Then I’m leaving! I’ll find her myself, I don’t care how long it takes!” Inziladûn cried. He meant to turn and make for the door, but before he could move his father struck him across the face, hard enough that he stumbled and fell. His head was still spinning when the Prince reached down and hauled him to his feet, his fingers digging painfully into Inziladûn’s upper arm.

“You are my eldest son, my heir. In poisoning your mind with her barbaric customs, Inzilbêth has tried to draw the future king of Anadûne into her treason, and there can be no forgiveness for such a crime.”

“Did you hit her, too?” The words felt distant, as though they had come from someone else’s mouth - they were foolish, and Inziladûn knew he would never have said them. 

Gimilzôr struck him again, not quite so hard this time. He seemed to have regained his earlier stern calm, but his grip on Inziladûn’s arm still hurt. “Perhaps spending a few weeks confined to your chambers will remind you of the duty you owe to me, to the King, and to all of Anadûne.”

He let go of his son’s arm, but not before gesturing to someone standing behind him. Two sets of hands fell on Inziladûn’s shoulders, and he flinched, recognizing the guards from the hallway. He bowed his head and stood very still as the Prince issued his orders, and did not struggle when the men led him away.

~

Someone opened the door behind him and Gimilkhâd spun around, hoping to see his mother or Inziladûn coming to tell him that everything was alright and that the shouting had nothing to do with them. Instead he saw his father the Prince standing in the doorway, bareheaded and informally dressed but still imposing. He looked grimmer than usual, and Gimilkhâd quickly dropped the toys he was playing with, scrambled to his feet, and bowed as he had been taught. 

But instead of addressing him formally, the Prince did something that he had never done before; he walked over to Gimilkhâd and knelt so that he did not tower over his son. Then he placed one hand on the boy’s shoulder and spoke to him kindly, without a trace of anger in his face or voice. 

“My son. I trust you are well?”

Gimilkhâd nodded, still nervous.

“I am glad to hear it. Unfortunately, I have grave news. Your mother and your brother have betrayed me, violating the laws of our forefathers as well as my trust.” The Prince sighed heavily. “The details do not concern you, but I must tell you that I have been forced to send your mother away, and to confine Inziladûn to his chambers for a time. It pains me greatly to do these things, but they have left me no choice. There may still be hope for your brother, but your mother has failed me utterly.” He gripped his son by both shoulders, and looked straight into his eyes. “I must put all my trust in you now, Gimilkhâd. Can I depend on you to remain loyal to the King, and to me?”

Gimilkhâd’s voice seemed to be caught in his throat, but he managed to reply, “Of course, Father.”   

“Good. I know you will not fail me. You must try to put your mother out of your mind, and forget anything she has taught you. She sought to turn Inziladûn against me, but you are still a true son of Anadûne.” The Prince squeezed Gimilkhâd’s shoulder, then stood and began to walk towards the door. 

Gimilkhâd took a deep breath and summoned all his nerve. “My lord,” he stammered. The Prince turned back to look at him, eyebrows raised. 

“What is it, my son?”

“May I see Inziladûn? Just for a few minutes?” Gimilkhâd took a deep breath, hoping he had not overstepped his bounds.

The Prince considered this, looking thoughtful rather than angry, which made Gimilkhâd feel a little better. At last he said, “You may. I will send a guard to escort you to him in a little while.”

Encouraged by this response, Gimilkhâd blurted out, “And my mother? May I see her, to say goodbye?”

This time there was a flash of true anger on his father’s face; he looked so furious that Gimilkhâd actually stepped back. But after a moment the rage was gone, so quickly that his son almost thought he had imagined it, and when the Prince spoke he sounded sympathetic.

“I’m afraid that is not possible. Your mother is already gone.”

And with that, he turned and strode from the room, leaving Gimilkhâd alone with his toys.

The man who came to fetch Gimilkhâd was young, and wore the plain uniform and blank expression of a member of the King’s personal guard. He walked slowly enough for the child to keep pace with him",candidate00014
"""Dior?""

He had not even heard her footsteps approaching, or the rustle of her dress as she sat down in the chair next to his. Nimloth resembled her mother’s kin with her soft brown hair and grey-green eyes, and she could move as quietly as any of them when she wished to.

""I heard that my uncle was here. Mablung told me that he went directly to you and left almost immediately, and that no one had seen you since."" Her casual tone did not quite mask her curiosity and concern.

When Dior did not answer, only continued to stare at the wall straight ahead of him, Nimloth changed the subject. “I took the boys out to the forest today. We just returned; they’re exhausted, poor dears. I decided it was time to teach them a few things.”

""What did you teach them?"" Dior asked quietly, still not looking at her.

""How to move in the forest without leaving a trace or making a sound,"" his wife said. ""How to hide so well that only other Lindi can find them. They’ll need to know these things when they go east to visit their cousins."" Nimloth smiled, and laid a hand on his arm. ""The way Uncle told it, you never quite got the hang of hiding. The other children always found you first.""

A tiny smile flickered across Dior’s face. “He was telling the truth. Almwë always said that my father was practically one of the Lindi himself, but I never achieved that kind of skill. Too much of my mother in me, he said. I stand out.” His face turned somber again, and Nimloth sighed. 

""Why was my uncle here? Ill news from Tol Galen?""

Dior gestured towards the simple wooden box that sat on the table before him. He heard his wife’s sharp intake of breath as she opened it, watched out of the corner of his eye as she recoiled from the light and then slowly leaned forward again. 

""Almwë brought it to me and left without saying a word,"" Dior heard himself say. ""It was the silence of mourning."" The Lindi communicated through silence as much as they did through speech, and living among them one learned to read it.

Nimloth sat very quietly for a moment, and Dior waited. At last she asked, “What will you do with it?”

He didn’t have to ask what she meant. “I do not know. I don’t even know how to face my people with this news. Barely a year ago they lost their king and queen, and now I have to tell them that my mother is gone. Lúthien Tinúviel, most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar, valiant foe of Morgoth and unrivaled in kindness.”

Nimloth smiled sadly, and her eyes glistened with unshed tears. She had been very fond of her mother-in-law, as had Elwing and the boys.

""And my father."" Dior’s voice shook slightly. ""The last time I saw him, he was strong enough to fight as hard as any elf. No matter how hard he tried, he never could stop fighting.""

He felt Nimloth’s callused hands take hold of his, and she pulled him to his feet. She looked directly at him, her delicate features impassive. 

""Did you know they’ve started calling you ‘Dior the Beautiful’?"" she asked, and he felt his face flush.

He had known, although nobody had yet called him that to his face, and he was not at all sure what to make of the title. “I-I don’t…” he stammered. 

""They say you are the very image of your mother."" She reached down and drew the necklace from its box, holding it up to catch the lamplight. Then she undid the clasp and, putting her arms around his neck, fastened it. The jewel felt very heavy where it rested on his chest, and the soft light it emitted illuminated Nimloth’s face, making her look even more radiant than usual.

""It looks very well on you,"" she said, and he could hear the weight of sadness in her voice. He pulled her close and held her tightly for a moment, taking comfort in the soft sound of her breathing and the warmth of her embrace.

When she stepped back, she was smiling again. “Wear it when you speak to your people. You are your parents’ son, and you will carry their strength with you wherever you go.”

He nodded, agreement and thanks and determination and regret all bound up in that one simple gesture. Nimloth’s silence told him that she understood. 

When Dior finally spoke, it was with conviction as strong as the stones of Menegroth. “Have the court assembled. I will address them today. I just need a moment to prepare.”

Nimloth smiled, and left the room as quietly as she had entered it.",candidate00014
"stop once all the Easterlings had fallen, the rage in his eyes changing slowly to fear, then hurry to Aerin’s side.

Now, as Túrin stared down at Sador’s body and struggled to take in the old man’s dying words, Aerin approached him. The tall young man followed close behind her and eyed Túrin warily, the bloody axe still hanging easily from his hand. 

“He speaks with the truth of death. You have learned what you would.” Aerin spoke more forcefully than she had when Brodda sat beside her, but she looked older now, and her face was not free of fear. “Now go swiftly! But go first to Morwen and comfort her, or I will hold all the wrack you have wrought here hard to forgive. For ill though my life was, you have brought death to me with your violence. The Incomers will avenge this night on all that were here. Rash are your deeds, son of Húrin, as if you were still but the child that I knew.”

Anger flared within him at her words. “And faint heart is yours, Aerin Indor’s daughter, as it was when I called you aunt, and a rough dog frightened you. You were made for a kinder world.” Túrin shook his head. “But come away - I will bring you to Morwen.” He reached out for her hand, and found the head of an axe blocking his way.

“Do not think to speak to the Lady Aerin that way, stranger,” the young man said angrily, his blue eyes flashing. “If you were truly our kinsman, you would not wrong her so! She has endured much for the people here - your mother and sister and many others would have died if she had not risked her life to help them!”

Túrin would have offered a scathing retort, but something the boy had said caught his attention. Our kinsman? “Aerin, who is this boy?” he demanded.

Aerin sighed, and laid a hand on the young man’s arm as if to calm him. “He is Tuor, son of Huor. Your cousin.”

“What?” Túrin frowned; that was impossible, surely. “Huor died childless, and my aunt…” he remembered hearing of Rían’s disappearance, which must have ended in her death even if she had been with child.

“Your aunt was taken in by elves who found her wandering in the forest, and she lived among them long enough to bear her son,” Aerin said wearily. “Brodda’s men captured him three years ago when Tuor and his caretakers attempted to flee south.”

As soon as Túrin took a closer look at the boy called Tuor, he could see that he did not merely look like the men from his childhood. He bore a strong resemblance to one very specific man who Túrin could remember quite clearly - an impossibly tall man with a brilliant smile, who had given him and Lalaith rides on his shoulders and sometimes brought them news from the north when their father could not come himself. 

“It’s true,” Tuor said defiantly, though he looked slightly taken aback by the way Túrin’s expression had softened. “My father fell beside yours at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and my mother died soon after my birth. I lived most of my life with the elves. But now I am a thrall, and Brodda made me pay dearly for being their son.” The matter-of-fact way he said it disturbed Túrin more than the hint of accusation in his voice. 

“I hope you will come with us as well, Tuor,” he said, rather stiffly. “My mother will be glad to know that you live.”

“I shall not accompany you,” Aerin said, her voice hard. “I should die as soon in the wild with you, as with the brute Easterlings. You cannot mend what you have done. Go! To stay will make all the worse, and rob Morwen to no purpose.” She turned to Tuor. “You should go with him. Find your kin, and bring them word of your mother, and of me.”

“My lady, I cannot abandon you!” Tuor protested. “The Easterlings will come, and they will kill you!” His voice broke slightly, and Túrin thought he might be holding back tears.

“And if you stay, they will kill you as well for your part in this,” Aerin said, in a gentler tone than  she had used with Túrin. “I would not last in the forest, but you are young and strong. I would have you live, Tuor.” 

The young man knelt before her on the blood-stained floor, but Aerin took his hand and raised him to his feet again. She hesitated, then embraced him fiercely for a moment. “Go,” she said, then looked at Túrin again, her face like stone. “See that no harm comes to him.” 

“I swear it.” Túrin bowed low, then turned and left the hall. After a moment, he heard footsteps behind him, and Tuor appeared at his side. He still carried the",candidate00014
"Japan, had requested all new models from her show in LA, thus most had to be flown in from other areas, like your sister.

            You ignored the man who stood in front of the group of models and parents explaining how the process would work. Yawning, you stood, muttered ""Bathroom,"" and crept to the exit.

            The heat of the hallway hit you with a hammer; your only relief was the small fan blowing in the doorway. It ruffled your hair and kept you just cool enough not to sweat as you decided on where you were going to go.

            The studio as a whole was very run down considering the caliber of designer and models. No air conditioning except in the room you'd just fled. Looking around, you caught sight of a ginger head of hair crossing the end of the hallway. Curious, and without any better plans, you decided to investigate. Maybe it was the guy from the pool; you hadn't really had a chance to thank him properly for pulling you out. You followed him to an office and felt the cool air flowing out the doorway. You leaned on the open doorframe, reveling in the breeze.

            He turned and caught sight of you in the doorway, a pile of papers in his arms. ""Hai?""

            ""Er... Hi?"" you replied, mistaking the question for a greeting. You gave a small smile and wave.

            He gave you a somewhat put out look. ""No. Hai. It means 'yes' in Japanese. Can I help you?""

            ""Oh... um... I was just admiring the AC,"" you admitted shyly.

            ""AC?""

            ""Air conditioning. It's hot in the hallway.""

            He nodded and went back to fussing with papers. You looked around at the messy office strewn with sketches, notebooks, magazines, and all number of various writing utensils. ""Would you like some help?""

            The boy looked at the mess, then at you, and back at the mess. He shrugged. ""Sure.""

            ""Just tell me where to put things.""

            After a few minutes of silence, you glanced over at the boy. ""I'm (Name) by the way.""

            ""Hikaru,"" he replied with a smile.

            ""So... Japan, huh? Are you related to the designer?"" you asked, putting pens back into a cup on the corner of the desk.

            ""She is my mother.""

            ""So... how do you like the US so far, Hikaru?""

            He shrugged noncommittally and continued with the papers. You lapsed into silence as well, unsure what other questions to ask.

            ""Hey! Models are supposed to be in the dressing rooms getting fitted!"" a man with a clipboard and faint accent called to you from the doorway. He motioned for you to come with him. Ignoring the man, you continued to pick up pens and colored pencils. You wondered absently about how many writing utensils one person could have.

            ""Hitachiin-san..."" the man spoke before lapsing into a string of foreign words.

            Hikaru looked up at you curiously, ""Are you one of mother's models?""

            ""No.""

            He turned back to the man and replied in Japanese. The man left and Hikaru looked at you again. ""If you are not a model, what are you doing here?""

            ""My sister, the girl that tried to drown me, is a model. I got to come along for the ride."" You sighed as the last pen displaced a flyer that fluttered to the ground. Hikaru bent over and picked it up.

            ""Fireworks?"" he asked.

            Mentally counting days, you couldn't believe the timing of the model fitting. You nodded. ""I can't believe it's the fourth already...""

            Hikaru regarded the flyer quietly for a moment before asking, ""Is the fourth special?""

            ""Yes! It's Independence Day!""

            ""That's a big day, right?""

            You grinned. ""Of course, it's America's birthday! Fireworks are an American tradition. You should go!""

            He cocked his head to one side, meeting your gaze with his. ""Really?""

            ""Yeah! You're in America; it would be wrong not to go."" You took the flyer from him and read it. ""Tell you what. I'll take you as a thank you for pulling me out of the pool."" You grinned at him.

 

Hikaru was a tad bit surprised. He was so bored and here you were offering to take him to see some fireworks. A night away from the hotel would be nice, and his mother would be busy with designs basically all night. You weren't a model, either, so there was little chance you were trying to garner favor with the designer's son. Putting on his best host club smile, he replied, ""I would love to.""

 

The change in Hikaru's demeanor from friendly to charming caught you off guard. ""Hotel lobby at six?"" he asked.

            All you could do was smile and nod.

            ""See you there,"" he said, turning and exiting",candidate00015
"drop from his face and regarded his brown eyes carefully. Usually there would be a hint of a joke by this point, if he were joking.


He shrugged. ""I'll have some wicked scars once it's healed. Besides, that's our lives, right? Honestly, I worry more about you when you walk home.""


You grinned and shook your head. Jax was probably your favorite member of the Seven, because he was a total sweetheart, despite your shared (illegal) occupation. ""I wonder what you're doing in the pits if you worry about a girl walking home alone at night.""


""I can't have a chivalrous streak?"" he teased.


""Have you seen our line of work?"" you replied incredulously.


""So? A pretty lady should always have an escort,"" Jax said with a wink and a hugely flirtatious grin. You smacked his arm lightly.


""It's a wonder you survive here."" There was a cry from down one of the dark hallways and then the roar of the crowd. ""Speaking of which… shouldn't you be working?""


Jax gave an over dramatic sigh and scratched at the bandage on his cheek. ""You obviously wouldn't know since you don't normally come Thursdays, but I'm the host tonight.""


You groaned. That was your least favorite thing to do: greet everyone who enters and direct them down one of three hallways: to drugs, to sex, or to battles. ""I'm so sorry.""


""No, no, it's alright,"" Jax said airily. ""Where to?"" he asked, bowing dramatically. ""Battles, battles, or battles?""


Giving a snort of laughter, you crossed your arms. ""I thought there were other choices?"" you asked playfully.


Jax looked at you and grinned wide, exposing his perfectly white teeth. ""Are you suggesting we get a room?""


Bubba, who had been silent through the exchange, kicked Jax hard in the shin.


""Ouch! Cool it, little guy. I'm teasing her.""


Bubba growled all the same, and you thought it better to continue on your way into the battling portion of the warehouse, which was by far the largest section.


As you walked down the hallway, the chatter of the crowd grew louder. There were more cheers and you heard a trainer's whistle blow. The trainer was booed away as you came to the closed door. Sighing, you recalled Bubba to his pokéball before pushing the heavy metal door to the side.

Okay, so... no Volkner this chapter. I'm sorry! But hopefully the Pits intrigue you enough to continue reading~ :3 Which brings me to the next point... the Pits are a bit complex. So it'll take a couple chapters to explain them. This one should clarify quite a bit!

Thank you dark_wing19 for being my beta, again! So without further delay, here's chapter two!

The smells of sweat, blood, and cigarette smoke assailed your nose as the door swung wide. The cacophony of voices, cheers, and jeers doubled in volume as you entered the adjoining warehouse. Your shoes clicked on the sheet metal platform as you shouldered your way through the crowded walkways. You'd always entered from the back entrance when you were working, so the throng of people was an obstacle you'd never faced before. Shoved to the center of the platform by the crowd, you quickly realized that it was less dense than the edges.


Of course, this made perfect sense to you with the way the room was set up. ""The Pits"" was a very literal name for this warehouse. The elevated sheet metal platform had nine battling arenas at ground level, six feet below the platform. These formed a three by three grid, separated by the eight foot wide steel railed walkways.


The only difficulty in walking towards the center of the pathways was that for maneuverability, you sacrificed the ability to actually see who occupied each pit. From prior knowledge, you knew that the four corner pits and the center one housed members of the Seven. However, which member was in which pit was anyone's guess. Nobody ever had the same pit two nights in a row, and half the time there was no set pattern to the rotation.


You squeezed your way to the front railing of the corner pit you were nearest to. Disappointment fluttered in your stomach as you saw that two girls occupied this pit: a woman in her mid twenties by the name of Janine (a member of the Seven), and her challenger.


Stuck against the rails now that you'd wormed your way to the front, you watched as Janine's mightyena sprinted at the opposition. The little rattata squeaked in terror and tried to flee, but was caught in powerful jaws.


""Finish it with a crunch!"" Janine commanded. The large black dog pokémon crunched down hard. The rattata let out a high pitched cry of pain and went limp. The trainer blew her forfeit whistle, but the mightyena ignored it. Blood dripped from its mouth as",candidate00015
"do it for her, but either way, the effect was enchanting. Kyouya felt the slight longing in his heart, while he knew Tamaki was quite possibly shattered. They'd all had a thing for Haruhi at one point, but there was one of her and six of them. She'd made her choice and it did no good dwelling on it.

            Tamaki collected himself rather well before gliding over to greet them. He gave Haruhi an overenthusiastic hug and shook Hikaru's hand vigorously before also giving him a hug. Once he'd said hello, the couple moved away from the door and Tamaki greeted the next couple with just as much gusto.

            Kyouya was able to pick out the red head, and his heart sank slightly. She would be with him. And sure enough, as Tamaki moved you came into view on the arm of Kaoru, looking more beautiful than ever. He wondered who had designed your dress, you or Kaoru, as you walked away.

            There were reasons he'd stopped keeping in touch with that member of the host club. While he tried to convince himself it was because someone in fashion could never be of use to him, he knew it was partly because Kaoru had stolen you away. He noted no engagement ring on your finger as you laughed at something Tamaki said before the blond kissed both of your cheeks in farewell and scurried off to socialize with other people.

            The angry, possessive beast Kyouya had thought he'd quashed reared it's ugly head as he followed your movements with his eyes. It urged him to take you back first chance he got. You'd been his light that last year of high school, and he wanted it back.

 


            ""Her mother is that famous American lawyer and her father is a very accomplished brain surgeon here in Japan. I want you to become friends with her so that, should I need a favor from her father, you can help me to get it,"" his father told him, handing over a slim manila envelope.



            Kyouya opened it and studied the file. You were two years his junior, having just moved up to the senior high school wing when school started in the fall. He shut it and nodded to his father with determination.



            ""It's done.""


 

            By the time you were finally alone, Kyouya had been rooted to the same spot for a good hour. He'd talked briefly to a couple people, but otherwise he'd just watched as you clung to Kaoru while he socialized. Being two years younger, you didn't know many of the people there, except for members of the host club. Even though Mori and Hunni had graduated before you'd entered high school, you'd met them during your time with Kyouya, and it was talking to them that had ultimately left you alone.

            ""____,"" Kyouya said as he approached. You bristled at the sound of his voice and turned to look at him, plastering a fake smile on your face.

            ""Kyouya. It's nice to see you well,"" you replied, frantically scanning the room for somebody to come to your rescue.


 



            ""I'm Ohtori Kyouya. It's a pleasure to meet you,"" he said, giving his warmest smile and extending a hand to you. Your face turned pink as you shook his hand and nervously gave him your name.



            ""That's a beautiful name. Are you lost?"" Kyouya's luck was with him; you'd walked into a Host Club meeting the day after his father had given him the assignment.



            ""V-very. I was looking for the library.""



            ""Let me show you where it is,"" he replied, offering his arm to you. You took it and followed him. Kyouya's act was working like a charm as he led you to the library and told you if you needed anything to just ask.



 


            ""How is school?"" he asked, trying desperately to make conversation.

            ""It's good. After Tamaki went to France to finish his degree and you guys all moved back to Japan, Kaoru moved up to New York. He contacted me about a summer internship for Yuzuha, his mother. After that, she'd paid for my schooling.""

            Kyouya nodded.

            ""It must have been a dark time, three years ago. Kaoru told me that Tamaki's grandmother made him return to France, and once he'd left, Haruhi chose Hikaru and the rest of you slowly came back to Japan.""

            The man nodded again, preferring to forget how their joint excursion to America to follow Haruhi had fallen to pieces. After graduating in May, Haruhi and Hikaru had been married and returned to Japan. Only further proving that it had been a disastrous idea to begin with. Getting back into his father's good graces had been one of the most difficult things Kyouya had ever done.

            ""So, how are you?""


 



            ""How are you,"" you paused and flushed before looking up at him and grinning, ""Kyouya-kun?""



            ""I could not be more fantastic,"" Kyouya replied, smiling warmly at you.",candidate00015
"hairdryer currently turned on high.
           

""There you are, ma'am.""
          

  After getting the old woman all squared away, Haruka turned and smiled at the man. ""Do you need me to touch up your roots, sir?""
           

He nodded stiffly, again, and followed Haruka over to the chair the old woman had vacated. ""Do you need a trim as well, or just the roots bleached?""
           

""Just the bleach.""
           

""If you could follow me over here..."" Haruka pointed to the sinks.
           

After adjusting the seat so her client was comfortable, she started rinsing his hair. As she ran her fingers through it, she noticed how damaged and melted it truly was. ""Who was the last person to do your hair?""
           

 He shrugged noncommittally, trying to ignore her as best he could and just get the stupid thing over with. Sometimes bleaching his hair was such a pain in the ass.
           

""Okay... um. I'm Watanabe Haruka. And you are?""
           

""Heiwajima Shizuo.""
           

Haruka nodded and gave a small smile. At least it was some sort of response. Having only lived in Ikebukuro since the school year started, she was ignorant to the whispers surrounding her current client.
           

 ""And, if you don't mind my asking, where do you work, Heiwajima-san?""
           

 Silence. They walked back over to her chair, and Shizuo sat down while Haruka went to get bleach.
           

The rest of the time was spent with Haruka probing as cautiously as possible for responses from her very antisocial client. While he found her infuriatingly annoying, Shizuo managed to keep his cool rather well, and was quite pleased with the end result. He ran a hand through his hair, noting that she'd put something in it to make it soft again, almost like his natural hair.
           

""And you should put this in your hair at least once a day to keep it soft, Heiwajima-san,"" Haruka told him, handing over a bright pink bottle. ""It works wonders on bleached hair. Oh! Let me wrap it up for you.""
           

Shizuo exited the salon with a small, brown package, and an only slightly put out expression on his face.
           

""Nothing was broken!"" one of the other hair stylists exclaimed, coming out of the break room. ""Amazing! How did you do it?""
           

 ""What do you mean?"" Haruka asked as she washed off the brush.
           

 ""Every time that Heiwajima Shizuo comes into the salon, whoever does his hair is fired and something is smashed!""

When Haruka got home, Rikiya was waiting with two small clay pots, potting soil, and two small day lilies. He grinned at her. ""Want to help me plant them, Haruka-neesan?""
           

 ""Sure,"" she replied, setting down her purse.
           

Her brother's lip had swollen considerably, but his nose had stopped bleeding. ""You really shouldn't be getting into fights like that, Ki-chan.""
           

""Why? I want to get stronger and protect you!""
           

""Fighting high schoolers won't make you stronger. Now come here."" She caught her little brother up in a hug before there was a knock at the door.
           

 ""I'll get it. You keep planting."" Haruka smiled and went to the door. Standing outside were two men. One had glasses and dreadlocks, and wore a black suit. The other, standing taller, hair newly bleached, in the same bartender outfit, was Heiwajima Shizuo.
           

 ""Tom-chan, how can I help you?"" Haruka asked innocently. She was not surprised to see the shorter man. He'd called and told her to expect a visit, but her newest client was a bit of a shocker. Of course, she shouldn't have been surprised that Tom had a bodyguard, considering his line of work.
           

""Have you gotten any of the money?"" he asked almost reluctantly.
           

 ""Some. Would you like to come in while I go get it?"" Haruka opened the door and ushered them inside before going to her purse.
           

 ""Who's at the door, Haruka-neesan?"" Rikiya asked.
           

""Tom-chan. Why don't you go find a place to put the lilies and water them, Ki-chan?"" Haruka ushered her brother into the next room with one clay pot in hand. She grabbed her purse, counted out all of her tips and returned to the two men waiting in the entryway.
           

""This is all I have for now. I'm sorry it's not even close to all of it."" She handed over the small stack of bills and smiled tentatively.
           

""It's fine. As long as you're paying.""
           

""I still can't thank you enough for lending me the money to get this apartment back. It means a lot.""
           

""I've put the pots away, Haruka-nee~!"" Rikiya sang happily. ""Does Tanaka-san want to stay for dinner?"" The little boy had taken a shine to the loan shark, as he came over every other week to collect payments. The boy was oblivious",candidate00015
".

You still didn't have an answer when there were no more pairs of lines in her lips, and so you returned your attention to the book. You slowly turned the pages until you were on the first chapter. You read the first page with painstaking attention to detail, reading every line, word, and character, trying with all of your might to determine whether this combination of words meant anything to you. If Cathy was asking, it was important.

Nothing about that first page held anything familiar to you. You closed the book and turned it over. Unlike the front cover, the back was black with a couple of lines of white lettering. There were no pictures behind the words, and no reviews of praise from critics above or below the block of text. Just the short summary and the barcode. You read the summary, hoping that it would jog your memory.


When a selkie's pelt is stolen, it's up to her girlfriend to find the culprit. But as the days pass, the selkie slowly begins to slip into madness. With no leads of the thief or the location of the pelt, she must decide whether to stay with the selkie or leave for a new life. As a human, she doesn't understand the gravity of the situation. Will her love prevail over the encroaching madness? Or will she give up and move on?


Deep down, you felt as though you knew this story, but you still didn't know if you'd read the book. It didn't look familiar to you. Cathy's intense gaze felt like it was boring holes into your forehead as you stared at the back cover. You counted the lines in the barcode. And then you counted how many different thicknesses of bars there were. And then you counted how many bars were of each thickness, all the while stalling against Cathy's stare. You wanted to give her the answer she wanted to hear.

""I don't think I have,"" you said after counting all of the characters in the summary, first without spaces or punctuation, then without spaces, then including spaces.

Cathy sighed and stood up.

You panicked. Cathy never had a visit this short. You had to keep her here, you weren't ready for her to leave.

""Is it a good book?"" you asked.

""You should read it."" Cathy picked up her purse and slung it over one shoulder. It was a purse that you had gotten her many years ago. The faux leather was beginning to crack, revealing white below the burgundy exterior. The straps had many lines of stitching from repairs over the years. It was the last Christmas present that you had given to her before everything changed.

""Are you leaving?"" you asked, moving your gaze from the old purse to catch her eye.

""I am. I'll be back tomorrow, okay?"" She bent down and kissed you softly on the lips before leaving the room. The heavy metal door swung shut behind her. You heard the lock grind shut from the outside as the metal mechanisms scraped against one another. Cathy's face appeared briefly behind the diamond mesh encased in glass that made up your only window, and then she was gone. When she left, so did your humanity. She was the only thing still grounding you in this world. You screamed and threw the book at the door before dropping to all fours and crawling in circles on the floor. There had to be a way out on one of the walls. If you just kept circling, kept looking, you would find it. And then you could go back to your life with Cathy. You had to find it. If you just kept circling, it would show up eventually.

 

Cathy clenched her skirt in her hands when you began screaming. As she walked away from your room escorted by a guard, she had to try to block you out. You always screamed and threw the book at the door when she left. Your mind only seemed present when she sat across from you. And even then, you weren't who you used to be. The guard put a comforting hand on her shoulder and squeezed lightly. He was trying to convey his sympathies, Cathy supposed, but it wouldn't work. Your craziness wasn't your fault; it hadn't been bad genetics or drugs. It had been someone else. Someone had taken a piece of your soul and run away with it.

""How was she today?"" the receptionist asked conversationally when Cathy returned her visitor's badge.

""Same as always.""

""Have there been any leads on her pelt?""

Cathy shook her head.

""That's a shame.""

""The selkie leaders aren't convinced that she'll return to normal anymore. It's been too long.""

""Are you giving up on her?""

Cathy shrugged. She asked herself that question every day. Did she give up on you? Did she move on with her life and leave you to rot in here? Or did she keep trying to break through the",candidate00015
".

            ""Santa!"" you whispered excitedly.

            The man's eyes snapped to you. It had been completely quiet, and your voice carried.

            ""Who is there?"" he asked with a heavy accent.

            ""Me!"" you crawled out from under the tree, your big dog following you.

            ""(Name)?"" he asked, and laughed heartily. ""Very clever. Now to bed.""

            ""But Santa..."" you whined, ""I want you to give this to Jack!"" you held up a lumpy, poorly wrapped package. You had done your best considering you'd done it in secret.

            ""Jack?""

            ""Jack Frost! He knows you!"" you said.

            ""Jack Frost?"" he chuckled. ""The Jack Frost?""

            ""Yeah!"" you grinned.

            ""He said he was going to be at the North Pole today! Can you give this to him?""

            ""North Pole?"" Santa asked. He added something under his breath. He took the gift. ""I will give it to Jack,"" he told you. ""Now, to bed!"" He ushered you from the room before leaving presents and going up the chimney once more.

 

            A tap on your window two days later woke you early in the morning. Jack, gray eyes, disheveled white hair, and all, was crouched on the roof smiling though your window at you. The green scarf that you'd made for him wrapped tightly around his neck.

            You got up, waking Rex from his sleep. The dog stayed on the foot of your bed as you opened the window and Jack hopped inside.

            ""I love it!"" he told you, grinning.

            ""Really?"" you asked.

            ""Yes! It's wonderful!"" he told you, crouching down to be level with you. Proudly, you noted that he didn't crouch nearly so much as he had when you'd first met. You were getting taller!

            ""And I wanted to give you a Christmas present, too.""

            ""Really?""

            Jack nodded, held his hand up to his mouth and blew. An ice rose formed in his hand, and he handed it to you. ""Merry Christmas (Name)!""

            You looked at it in wonder, turning the frozen thing in your hands. It was already melting, but it was still beautiful.

            ""Now, what are we going to play today?"" he asked, grinning.

Baking Goodies - 13 years old

            Your mom was letting you make the sugar cookies this year. You felt so proud of yourself. You were finally old enough to be trusted in the kitchen. It was about time. You were thirteen after all. You were a teenager now! Not a baby.

            ""I need three batches, sweetheart,"" your mom said, kissing your forehead.

            ""Mom!""

            ""I can't kiss my baby?"" she asked.

            ""I'm not a baby!"" you protested, crossing your arms and frowning at her.

            She only smiled knowingly.

            ""Alright. Well, I'll be back after I run some errands. You and I can frost them if you're not done.""

            You ignored her in favor of pulling out ingredients. As you worked, you noticed that the kitchen window over the sink was frosted over. You could see the hand as it drew a picture of two stick figures flying over trees. Afterwards, it wrote a question mark. Snowy hair, gray eyes, and then that grin that meant trouble appeared in the window, along with the long crooked stick.

            Shaking your head, you went over and opened the sliding glass door.

            ""Why not?!""

            ""I'm making cookies!""

            Jack looked into the kitchen, which was a horrible mess. It looked like he'd already been in there; white powder covered almost every surface possible, including the thirteen year old in front of him. He wiped a smudge of flour off of your cheek and grinned.

            ""Can I help?""

            ""What do you know about baking, Jack?"" you asked in disbelief, putting your hands on your hips. If not for the flour, you would have been very sassy looking.

            ""I'll show you,"" he grinned and walked past you into the kitchen. He opened the fridge with his staff and balanced a carton of eggs on it and set it down on the counter. He then closed the fridge, cracked the eggs, and threw the eggshells at you before ducking.

            ""Hey!"" you squealed, running around the counter to try and catch the teenager of myth. He simply chuckled and jumped over the counter in one fluid motion, effectively evading you. However, the handful of flour you threw at him landed dead center on the front of his hoodie, making it look even more frosted than it already was.

            ""Oh, this means war,"" Jack said, making a snowball and chucking it at you. He missed, and the snow exploded against a cabinet door. You threw more flour at him as you ducked below the counter.

            This duck and throw game went one for an hour. When you were done, pools of water and flour littered the kitchen. Rex,",candidate00015
"there'd been the night he'd frozen the teddy bear to your window. He liked to check on your more and more often as you grew up. He wasn't sure why, but it didn't matter. He liked how human you were; you had a life, just like he wanted. Who wanted to be Jack Frost? All alone and forgotten.

""Hey! Who are you?"" you asked, glancing up from your history textbook, and noticing the teenager standing in your window. He wore a navy blue hoodie covered in frost and carried a staff much like a shepherd would have.

""Who? Me?"" he asked, pointing at himself.

""Is there anyone else out there?"" you asked. You knew you should have been more perturbed by this boy snooping around, but he seemed really familiar. Almost like an old friend. This was weird. You'd never seen him before. Of that, you were almost positive.

""Jack Frost,"" he told you. You rolled your eyes and went back to reading.

""Very funny. Which one sent you? Kaylee or Molly?"" Your friends hated your obsession with Jack Frost, and did everything in their power to make fun of you. Their newest stunt took dedication though. He was a very impressive looking young man; they probably paid him a lot to play the part.

""No seriously! I'm Jack Frost!"" the boy insisted. ""I can show you!""

""Alright. Show me,"" you replied, getting off your bed and walking over to the window. You crossed your arms and waited for something to happen.

The boy grinned at you and tapped his staff to the window. Frost curled out from the spot the staff touched. ""This is what I do every Christmas,"" he told you, grinning. He puffed up his chest with pride as you gaped at him.

""You… you're real!""

You'd been talking through the window, but you slid the window open to a blast of cold air. ""You're real!"" you said again. This couldn't be a joke; how would he know about the Christmas morning frost patterns? You'd told no one about those.

He chuckled happily and scratched the back of his head. ""Yup!""

""You don't understand. I have to tell everybody! You have to come with me! They'll believe me once they see you!"" you told him.

""Uh… That won't –"" Jack began, but you talked over him.

""Stay right there! I'll be right outside! Just, don't go away!""

Jack watched as you pulled on furry snow boots, grabbed your coat, and dashed out of your bedroom door. Seconds later, you came around the corner, panting from your sprint out of the house.

""Good! You're still here!"" you said, straightening.

Jack chuckled nervously. Now that somebody actually could see him, he wasn't sure what to do… his people skills were very rusty, he had only the kangaroo with over sized ears and the yeti minions of the big guy to interact with for the past three hundred years.

""Still here,"" he replied.

""You have to come with me to see my friends!"" you told him, grabbing his hand and pulling him towards the sidewalk in the front of your house. His hand was freezing in yours, but it wasn't surprising considering that he was in charge of winter.

Jack, however, was caught by surprise by how warm your hand was in his as you pulled him forward. He forgot for a moment that your friends wouldn't see him as he followed you around to the front of the house. When he collected his wits, he dug in his heels and staff, bringing you to a stop.

""What's wrong?"" you asked him, turning around to look at the young man.

""They won't see me.""

""What are you talking about? You're right here! Of course they'll see you!""

Jack shook his head and kicked at the ground. His shoulders slumped, and he wouldn't look at you. You dropped his hand.

""Why won't they see you?""

""Only people who believe in me can see me.""

""That's ridiculous!""

Jack tapped the long wooden staff against his shoulder a couple times before looking up at you. ""It's not. It's the truth. Until recently, you're the only one who believed in me.""

""How do you know that?"" you asked.

""I've… uh…"" Jack flushed, which surprised you considering how cold his hand had been. ""I've visited you more than a few times. After the teddy bear, I knew you must believe in me.""

""You've been… watching me?"" you asked, shivering.

""Oh no. Not like that!"" Jack said, taking a step forward and waving his hands in front of him.",candidate00015
